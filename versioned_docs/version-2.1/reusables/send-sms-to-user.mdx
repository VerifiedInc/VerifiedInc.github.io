    **Our [test user](/environments#test-user)'s phone numbers aren't valid phone numbers, so sending SMS to them won't work.** You can simulate the SMS step by using the [static verification code](/environments#test-user) (`111111`), but we recommend instead using your own phone number(s) for testing, so you can send yourself real SMS messages.
