    <summary>How to Create a Dashboard Account</summary>

    <h3>
        a. Enter your email and click the 1-Click Login button.
    </h3>

    We'll send you a verification code by email.

    <WorkEmailAdmonition />


    <h3>
        b. Complete the verification step.
    </h3>

    Click the verification button in the email or enter the verification code. We'll automatically log you in. _It's a 1-click experience, as promised!_


    <h3>
        c. (optional) Set up MFA.
    </h3>

    Set up multi-factor authentication with an authenticator app. This is optional until you request approval for [Production](/api-reference/environments#production) access, at which point it's required.


    <h3>
        d. (if necessary) Confirm your company name.
    </h3>

    If you're creating the Dashboard account for your company, we'll ask you to confirm your company name. _If someone on your team has already created your account, you won't need to do this._

    If your account doesn't have a brand yet, we'll automatically create one for you and take you to its Brand Details page.

    <h3>
        e. (optional) Invite team members.
    </h3>

    Invite your team members to join your Dashboard account.
