## About 1-Click Health

**1-Click Health autofills health insurance data for a user,** so they can share it in less than 30 seconds.

{/* **See [Outputs](/reference/data/outputs) for what this data can include.** We provide a wide range of [credentials](/reference/data/outputs#credentials) (pieces of user identity data) and rich [metadata](/reference/data/outputs#metadata) about them, including dozens of sophisticated [risk signals](/reference/data/outputs#metadata#risk-signals). */}

{/\* ## User Experience

To use 1-Click Health, all a user needs to do is:

1. Enter and verify phone number
2. (if necessary) Enter birthday/SSN4
3. Confirm autofilled info

_It takes less than 10 seconds, end to end!_

1-Click Signup uses the exact same user experience as 1-click checkout solutions (like Stripe Link and Shop Pay), so it's familiar to users. See [User Experience](/1-click-signup/user-experience) for full details.

:::note
Step 2 above — prompting for a challenge (birthday/SSN4) — is necessary only if the phone number alone doesn't uniquely identify the user, for example if it's part of a shared phone carrier plan. (You can also configure your brand settings to always [prompt for a challenge](/1-click-signup/guides/setup#prompt-for-challenges).)

## Benefits

- **Increase conversion:** Dramatically reduce friction, making it as easy as possible for new users to share their insurance data.
- **Delight users:** Avoid aggravating users by asking them to type in their payer, member ID, and more. Given them a magical first experience with your brand.
- **Prevent fraud:** Stop bad actors by autofilling insurance data and using our [risk signals](/reference/data/outputs#metadata#risk-signals) metadata.

## Coverage

We can source verified health insurance data for about **85% of US adults (226M people).** The data is extremely high quality because we waterfall across a number of data provider partners like clearing houses.
