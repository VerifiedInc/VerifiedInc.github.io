## About 1-Click Signup

**1-Click Signup is the _fastest_ way to sign up new users.** From just a phone number, Verified can autofill a user's data so they can share it in less than 10 seconds.

**See [Outputs](/reference/data/outputs) for what this data can include.** We provide a wide range of [credentials](/reference/data/outputs#credentials) (pieces of user identity data) and rich [metadata](/reference/data/outputs#metadata) about them, including dozens of sophisticated [risk signals](/reference/data/outputs#risk-signals).

## User Experience

To use 1-Click Signup, all a user needs to do is:

1. Enter and verify phone number
2. (if necessary) Enter birthday/SSN4
3. Confirm autofilled info

_It takes less than 10 seconds, end to end!_

1-Click Signup uses the exact same user experience as 1-click checkout solutions (like Stripe Link and Shop Pay), so it's familiar to users. See [User Experience](/1-click-signup/user-experience) for full details.

:::note
Step 2 above — prompting for a challenge (birthday/SSN4) — is necessary only if the phone number alone doesn't uniquely identify the user, for example if it's part of a shared phone carrier plan. (You can also configure your brand settings to always [prompt for a challenge](/1-click-signup/guides/setup#prompt-for-challenges).)
:::

## Benefits

- **Increase conversion:** Dramatically reduce friction, making it as easy as possible for new users to share their verified data.
- **Streamline KYC operations:** Avoid user error and increase pass rates by leveraging our autofilled, verified data.
- **Prevent fraud:** Stop bad actors by using our [risk signals](/reference/data/outputs#risk-signals) metadata.

## Coverage

We can source verified data for about **95% of US adults (253M people)** — if you provide both phone and a challenge (either birthday or SSN4) as inputs — and for about **20%** if you provide only phone. _Exact coverage depends on your user base._

<CoverageUsOnlyAdmonition />

The data is extremely high quality because it comes from phone carriers, credit bureaus, and other trusted providers. Thanks to this quality, the data can be leveraged as part of a KYC/AML process.

:::warning 1-Click Signup is Not Full KYC
If your use case requires KYC (Know Your Customer) verification, the data we return can dramatically improve your processes by increasing pass rates and reducing incorrect and fraudulent data. **However, 1-Click Signup by itself is _not_ full KYC.** You should pass the data you receive from us through an additional KYC process to ensure compliance.

We're soon adding full KYC to 1-Click Signup, so we can provide you with a full stack solution. If that would be helpful for you, email us at Support@Verified.inc and we'll let you know when it's available.
