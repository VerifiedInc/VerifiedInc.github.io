:::info Why Multiple Brands?
Your company account can have one or more brands. Generally, you'll only need one brand, but there are some cases where it's helpful to use multiple. For example:
- **If you have multiple products:** If you have products that go by different names, it can be useful to create different brands to help users know which product they're using 1-Click Signup for — and to help your team track metrics specific to that product.
- **If you want to try different brand settings:** If you want to change brand settings without affecting your existing implementation (even in Sandbox), you can duplicate your brand and configure different settings on the new brand.
