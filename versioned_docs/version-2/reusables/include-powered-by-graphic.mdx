We require you to include a graphic that says "1-Click Signup powered by Verified". This helps the user understand they're about to go through a 1-Click Signup flow â€” and motivates them to do so, since a 1-click experience is always best!

The graphic should be placed just below the trigger you use to start the 1-Click Signup flow. Usually, this is a phone number or birth date input or a button.
    
We provide several variants of the graphic, in both SVG and PNG format. Choose the one you prefer and that best fits the background color of your application.
