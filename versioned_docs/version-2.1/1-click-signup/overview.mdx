## About 1-Click Signup

**1-Click Signup is the _fastest_ way to sign up new users.** From just a phone number, Verified can autofill a user's data so they can share it in less than 10 seconds.

**See [Data](./data) for what this data can include.** We provide a wide range of [credentials](./data/outputs/credentials) (pieces of user identity data) and rich [metadata](./data/outputs/metadata) about them, including dozens of sophisticated [risk signals](./data/outputs/metadata#risk-signals).

:::info Privacy First
**A user's data is never shared without their consent.** We are committed to putting people in control of their own data. We are SOC 2 Type II certified and compliant with major regulatory frameworks like GDPR and CCPA. For more information, please see [How We Operate](https://www.verified.inc/how-we-operate).

## User Experience

To use 1-Click Signup, all a user needs to do is:
1. Enter and verify phone number
2. (if necessary) Enter birthday/SSN4
3. Confirm autofilled info

_It takes less than 10 seconds, end to end!_ 

1-Click Signup uses the exact same user experience as 1-click checkout solutions (like Stripe Link and Shop Pay), so it's familiar to users. See [User Experience](./guides/user-experience) for full details.

:::note
Step 2 above — prompting for a challenge (birthday/SSN4) — is necessary only if the phone number alone doesn't uniquely identify the user, for example if it's part of a shared phone carrier plan. (You can also configure your brand settings to always [prompt for a challenge](./guides/setup#prompt-for-challenges).)

## Benefits

- **Increase conversion:** Dramatically reduce friction, making it as easy as possible for new users to share their verified data.
- **Streamline KYC operations:** Avoid user error and increase pass rates by leveraging our autofilled, verified data.
- **Prevent fraud:** Stop bad actors by using our [risk signals](./data/outputs/metadata#risk-signals) metadata.


## Coverage

We can source verified data for about 95% of US adults (253M people). The data is extremely high quality because it comes from phone carriers, credit bureaus, and other trusted providers. Thanks to this quality, the data can be leveraged as part of a KYC/AML process.

:::important
**We currently only cover people in the United States.** But we are soon adding new geographies. If there are particular geographies that would be most helpful for our use case, please let us know by emailing Support@Verified.inc, and we'll prioritize accordingly.

## Integration

Integrating 1-Click Signup is simple. How long it takes depends on the [integration type](./guides/setup#integration-type) you choose:
- \<1 day for [**SDK**](./guides/sdk-integration)
- 1-2 weeks for [**API**](./guides/api-integration)

To integrate, first follow the [Setup](./guides/setup) guide and then either the [SDK Integration](./guides/sdk-integration) or [API Integration](./guides/api-integration) guide.
