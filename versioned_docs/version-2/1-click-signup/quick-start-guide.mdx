## Setup


### 1. Log into the Dashboard.

<SetupLoginToDashboard/>

**For this Quick Start Guide, just leave the default brand settings in place.** Notice that the default setting for **integration type** is Hosted. This means you'll use a user interface and phone verification that Verified hosts. This is the quickest way to get started.

For full technical details on how to integrate 1-Click Signup, see [Integration Guide](./integration-guide). For more information on integration types, see [Determine your integration type](./integration-guide#2-determine-your-integration-type).


## 1-Click Signup


### 2. Call `POST /1-click`.

Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click) with your own phone number (or one of our [test user](./environments#test-user)'s phone numbers). Use the Sandbox API key for the brand you just created in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).
    
The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain `url` and `code`, which you'll use in the following steps.

In a full integration, you'd send an SMS containing `code` to the user to verify the phone number. But for this Quick Start Guide, we'll skip the SMS step. Just pretend you sent the SMS.


### 3. Complete user experience.

Because for this Quick Start Guide we're using a Hosted integration type, the 1-Click Signup user interface will be hosted by Verified (at `url`).


#### a. Navigate to `url`.

Open `url` in any web browser, on any device. This will take you to our hosted user interface. 


#### b. Enter `code`.

When we prompt you for a verification code, enter `code`.


#### c. Click the 1-Click Signup button.

We'll display your (mock) verified data and ask you to confirm you want to share it with the brand. Do so by clicking the 1-Click Signup button.

Then, we'll redirect you to the default redirect URL defined in your brand settings in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc). (Unless you changed what we autofilled, this will be the same as your email domain.) We'll append an `identityUuid` URL parameter, which you'll use in the next step.


### 4. Call `GET /1-click`.

Call [`GET /1-click/{identityUuid}`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click) with the value of the `identityUuid` URL paramter on the redirect URL we navigate you to. 

:::tip
If you can't find the `identityUuid` parameter (for example if your website automatically strips URL parameters), you can instead use `uuid` from the response body of `POST /1-click`, which has the same value.
:::

The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click-response) will be a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), which contains the user's data and metadata about it. You can use this data however you like to create a new account for the user!
