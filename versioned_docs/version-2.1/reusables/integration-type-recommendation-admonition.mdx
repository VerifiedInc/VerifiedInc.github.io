<Admonition type="tip" title="We Strongly Recommend the SDK Integration Type">
    **The SDK integration type is by *far* the easier option, and we strongly recommend using it.** The SDK handles almost everything for you and is highly customizable, so you can use it to exactly match your branding and desired user experience. It implements our recommended [user experience](/1-click-signup/user-experience), which is hyper optimized from our experience verifying millions of users.

    With the **API** integration type, you need to handle everything yourself, and you need approval from us to go live.
