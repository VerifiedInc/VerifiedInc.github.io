*Docs for the Android SDK are [here](mobile-sdk-android).*

This is a lightweight, fully native SDK that allows a host app to receive and store <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>, receive <Tip type="request">requests</Tip>, and share <Tip type="presentation">presentations</Tip>. It works with both Swift and Objective-C native apps.

**Before you begin:** You need to be registered as Unum ID customer, and you need to register at least one <Tip type="holder app"/>. (You can register zero to many, depending on your use case.) You'll receive a holder app API key to use with this SDK.

## Overview

### Minimum Requirements
- **iOS 13 and above**
- **English language** (internationalization coming soon)

The code defines a UnumIDVerified class which is used for verifying user credentials. It provides several functions for handling the verification process, including:

hasMatchingCredentials - Makes an API request for matching the user's credentials
launchActivate - Launches an activation process for the user to issue credentials
launchVerify - Launches a verification process for the user
The UIViewController extension provides two additional functions for launching verification/activation modals and a web view for showing the results.

The View extension provides a view modifier launchWebView which launches a web wallet with a shared Safari session.

The Configuration struct inside UnumIDVerified is used to set up the UI of the activation process. The UI has two properties:

titleFont - Font used for the title
titleColor - Color used for the title.

:::note
Note: The code also makes use of several other classes and structs, including ApiRequest, PostHasMatchingRequest, PostHasMatchingCredentialsResource, Result, Error, ActivateModalViewController, CardPopupViewController, VerifyModalViewController, PostIssueCredentialsRequest, PostIssueCredentialsResponse, and WebViewController.
:::


```swift
// Create an instance of PostHasMatchingRequest
let matchingRequest = PostHasMatchingRequest(id: "12345")

// Call the hasMatchingCredentials method
UnumIDVerified.shared.hasMatchingCredentials(request: matchingRequest) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let url):
        // Launch the Web View with the URL
        let viewController = UIViewController()
        viewController.launchWebView(url: url)
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle the error
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}

// Create an instance of PostIssueCredentialsRequest
let credentialsRequest = PostIssueCredentialsRequest(id: "12345")

// Call the launchActivate method
UnumIDVerified.shared.launchActivate(for: "company", request: credentialsRequest, on: viewController) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let response):
        // Handle the success response
        print(response)
    case .failure(let error):
        // Handle the error
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}

// Call the launchVerify method
UnumIDVerified.shared.launchVerify(for: "company", on: viewController) {
    // Handle the continue action
}
```

## Setup

### `Info.plist`

Because the SDK requires camera and biometric/passcode [permissions](#permissions), you need to add descriptions like these to the `Info.plist` file:

#### Privacy - Camera Usage Description 
> This app would like to use the camera for QR code scanning.

#### Privacy - Face ID Usage Description
> This app would like to use Face ID for authorization.

#### Privacy - Touch ID Usage Description
> This app would like to use Touch ID for authorization.

### Installation

When you register a <Tip type="holder app"/>, we will send you the SDK as a compiled binary library.

### Access to Current View Controller

The SDK needs access to the current view controller to show system alerts to the user (this is essential for the SDK to work). So, you should always pass the this to the SDK like so:

```swift
UnumPresenterHelper.currentViewController = viewController
```

### Configuration

The Android SDK has the ability for some aspects of its functionality to be customized to the client application. The following preferences can be set at a global level for the SDK.
- `useFullScreenDialog` :  If the SDK handles showing a presentation request, should it be shown in a system dialog or a full screen presentation.
- `returnPresentationDetails` :  Should the presentation request be handled by the client application. This would allow the client application to show a custom UI for presentation requests.

```swift
UnumId.configure(UnumSDKConfig(useFullScreenDialog = true, returnPresentationDetails = false))
```

### Initialization

You should initialize the SDK when the app starts up. This will ensure the SDK is set up properly. 

You can optionally include a <Tip type="DID"/> (`did`), which identifies a user (technically called a <Tip type="subject"/>) in the Unum ID ecosystem. A returning user will already have a DID, so you should include this to ensure the SDK loads any new credentials associated with that DID as part of the initialization process. 

You can optionally include the `UnumCallback` to be notified of the result of the initialization call.

After a user has successfully log in to the host app, and initialization call should be made to the SDK. The host app should store a reference to the user DID so that it can be passed to the initialization call. If a DID is not provided a new one will be created and returned.

```swift
let userDid = { /* retreive user DID */ }
let config = UnumInitializationConfiguration(customerId: BuildConfig.CustomerId, // your customer UUID
apiKey: BuildConfig.ApiKey, // your holder app API key
did: userDid, // (optional) include this for returning users — otherwise leave empty
onError: {}, // (optional) run if there's an error
authorizeRecoveryFromBackup: {  } // (optional) run when restoring from backup
)

classInitializationCallback: UnumCallback {
    internal init(_ parent: MainView) {
        self.parent = parent
    }
    
    let parent: MainView
    func onSuccess(data: String?) {
        // returned data will be user's DID if new one was created
    }

    func onSDKError(error: String?) {
        print("SDK Error: \(error ?? "")")
    }

    func onAPIError(code: Int, error: String?) {
        print("API Error \(error ?? "")")
    }
}
UnumID.initialize(configuration: config, callback: InitializationCallback(self))
```

The initialization process involves creating private keys for the user using the secure hardware of the device. This requires OS level authentication, so the user will be prompted to pass a biometric check or enter their passcode. If they don't have this set up, the SDK will direct them to the correct place in Settings to do so.


### Deep Links

In the context of Unum ID, a **deep link** is a URL that opens a specific <Tip type="holder app"/>. For example, a link that opens the ACME Bank mobile app might look like this:

```
unumid://acme/presentationRequest/88d37012-f83b-453a-a1f1-d4a1bcf86aa3
```

The SDK uses deep links to retrieve and display a <Tip type="request"/> to a user, who decides whether to share data in response. Users will typically encounter deep links displayed in the [Web SDK](/web-sdk) (in QR code or button form) or sent over a communication channel (like push notification, SMS, or email).

You need to pass Unum ID deep links to the SDK to be processed. To do so, set up your host app to receive the appropriate schemas. (You can optionally add logic to determine if the deep link should be passed to the SDK.) Do this in the **Target -> Info** tab.

![Url type](../assets/images/url-types.png)

Here's an example of sending the deep link to the SDK in `SceneDelegate`:

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
    for context in URLContexts {
        UnumID.acceptDeepLink(link: context.url.absoluteString)
    }
}
```

When it receives a deep link, the SDK will display a system alert, asking the user how they want to respond to the <Tip type="request"/> (that the deep link references).


### Event Listener

In the case that the client application would like to be responsible to showing a custom UI for presentation requests, the
`UnumEventLister` should be set by the client application. This will allow the client application to listen for SDK events.
Events will be sent to the client application with a `EventType` and a `JSON` payload.

To set the listen in the SDK call:

```swift
UnumID.setEventListener(listener: UnumEventListener)
```
### Presentation Response

When the client application is handling the UI for a presentation request, the selected results for the request can be sent
to the SDK with `onPresentationResponse`. This should include an enum of the response (Accept, Decline, FLag), and the original JSON payload. However,
the payload can be modified by the client application to only include selected credentials in the case that some credentials are optional, or there are
multiple values for same credential type.

```swift
UnumID.onPresentationResponse(responseType: PresentationResponse, json: String)
```


### QR Code Scanner

The Unum ID [deep links](#/deep-links) described above can be displayed in QR code form. This is important for cases when a user is on a non-mobile device. For example, the ACME Bank website might request that a user share an authentication credential to log into the ACME website on desktop. ACME would do so by displaying a QR code that the user scans. This would open the ACME mobile app on the user's phone and prompt the user to share the requested data.

Any QR code scanner can read an Unum ID deep link in QR code form. iOS devices support scanning directly from the native camera, but you should also allow the user to scan codes from within your app.

If you already have a QR code scanner, you can pass QR codes directly to the SDK like so:

```swift
UnumID.acceptDeepLink(link: scannedCode)
```

If you don't have a QR code scanner, you can use the one included in the SDK. This will automatically pass the deep link to the SDK — no further action is needed from the host app.

```swift
var scannerSheet: some  View {
    UnumCodeScannerView(
        codeTypes: [.qr],
        completion: { result in
            self.isShowingScanner = false
        }
    )
}
```

You can open this on a trigger of your choice. For example, you can create a "Scan QR Code" button that opens the scanner when the user clicks it:

```swift
@State var isShowingScanner = false


Button(action: {
    self.isShowingScanner = true
}) {
    Text("Scan QR Code")
    .font(.headline)
    .foregroundColor(.white)
    .padding(.all)
    .frame(width: 300, height: 50)
    .background(Color.blue)
    .cornerRadius(15.0)
}.sheet(isPresented: $isShowingScanner) {
    self.scannerSheet
}
```

### Logging

You can turn SDK logging on and off and set the log level:

```swift
// Turn the SDK logger on or off
UnumID.log.enabled = true
// If logger enabled, set desired message log level
UnumID.log.level = .debug
```

### Callback

You can pass the `UnumCallback` to most method calls within the SDK. This adds a listener that records the result of the method call – a successful call, an SDK error, or an API error. The [Initialization](#initialization) section shows one example of this, and here's another:

```swift
classInitializationCallback: UnumCallback {
    internal init(_ parent: MainView) {
        self.parent = parent
    }

    let parent: MainView
    func onSuccess(data: String?) {
        // returned data will be user DID if new one was created
    }

    func onSDKError(error: String?) {
        print("SDK Error: \(error ?? "")")
    }

    func onAPIError(code: Int, error: String?) {
        print("API Error \(error ?? "")")
    }
}
UnumID.initialize(configuration: config, callback: InitializationCallback(self))
```

## Handling Multiple Users

Each user is identified by some user ID in your system and by a <Tip type="DID"/> in the Unum ID ecosystem. You simply need to store an association between each user ID and DID. That way, when your host app has a particular user ID (for example once a user is logged into your existing account system), it can pass the corresponding DID to the SDK.

If you don't have existing user IDs, you *could* use the DIDs themselves as user IDs. However, we recommend using separate identifiers (internal to your company), to distinguish them from DIDs, which are global to the Unum ID ecosystem.

:::note
The technical details of DIDs are not relevant to deploying or using Unum ID. You can think of DIDs as identifiers in the normal sense — unique, random strings of characters like UUIDs.

When you [initialize](#initialize) the SDK, you can optionally include a DID. 
- **Don't include a DID for a user who's new to the SDK.** The SDK will generate a new one that you should store, associated with the user ID in your system.
- **Do include a DID for a user who returns to the SDK.** The SDK will use this DID to access the correct stored data for that user.

:::important
DIDs are the *only* identifiers the SDK understands, so it relies entirely on the host app to pass the correct one. 

For example, suppose Users 1 and 2 are associated with DIDs 1 and 2, respectively. If User 1 is using the host app, but the app passes DID 2 to the SDK, the SDK will give User 1 access to to User 2's data.
:::

### Example Flow

1. **New User 1 logs into host app.**
    - SDK is initialized with no DID.
    - SDK returns newly generated DID 1.
    - Host app stores DID 1 and associates it with User 1.
2. **New User 2 logs into host app.**
    - SDK is initialized with no DID.
    - SDK returns newly generated DID 2.
    - Host app stores DID 2 and associates it with User 2.
3. **Returning User 1 logs into host app.**
    - Host app retrieves DID 1 and includes it in SDK initialization.
    - SDK recognizes this is a returning user and does not generate a new DID.
