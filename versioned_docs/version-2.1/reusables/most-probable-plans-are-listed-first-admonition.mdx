<Admonition type="tip" title="Most Probable Plans are Listed First">
    If we return multiple health insurance plans for a user, they're **ordered from most to least probable.** _All plans we return have a high probability of matching the user, since we filter out low probability ones._

    A user may have multiple plans, for example if they have separate ones for medical, dental, or vision. **We recommend that you let the user choose which plan they want to use,** setting the first plan we return (which we deem most probable) as the default choice.
