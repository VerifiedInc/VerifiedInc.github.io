**Never use Verified API keys client side. Only use them server side.** Verified API keys allow you to source sensitive data about users, so you must keep them secure. If you use a Verified API key client side, our firewall will block your request, and you'll get [this firewall error](/reference/api/errors#api-key-used-client-side).
