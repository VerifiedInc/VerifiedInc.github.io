**Complete this Setup guide before following the [SDK Integration](../guides/sdk-integration) or [API Integration](../guides/api-integration) guide.** (Which integration guide you should follow depends on which [integration type](#integration-type) you choose.)
:::


## 1. Access the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).

<SetupLoginToDashboard/>


## 2. Configure brand settings.

On the Brand Details page in the Dashboard, you can configure settings for your brand. 


### Brand Name

Choose a name for your brand. This will be used elsewhere in the Dashboard (for example on the Metrics page) and displayed to users if you choose the **SDK** [integration type](#integration-type).


### Integration Type

Choose which integration type you want to use:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Development Effort</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>**SDK** <Chip label="Recommended" variant="outlined" size="small" color="primary"/> <br/> <span class="font-weight-normal"></span></td>
        <td>\<1 day</td>
        <td>You use our (web) client SDK, and we handle the rest</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>**API** <Chip label="Requires Approval" variant="outlined" size="small" color="warning"/> <br/> <span class="font-weight-normal"></span></td>
        <td>1-2 weeks</td>
        <td>You use our API only and build everything yourself</td>
    </tr>
</table>

:::note Looking for Hosted, Semi-Hosted, or Non-Hosted?
<div class="small-margin-bottom">**We’ve reorganized!** The integration types [in v2.0](/v2.0/integration-guide#2-configure-brand-settings) are updated for v2.1 as follows:</div>
- **Hosted** in v2.0 is replaced by **SDK** in v2.1
- **Semi-Hosted** in v2.0 is no longer available in v2.1
- **Non-Hosted** in v2.0 is equivalent to **API** in v2.1

{/* ### Phone Verification

Choose whether to use Verified's phone verification or your own:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Use Verified's</td>
        <td>Use Verified to send the user verification SMS.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Use your own <Chip label="Requires Approval" variant="outlined" size="small" color="warning"/></td>
        <td>Use your own solution to send the user verification SMS.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

:::important You Must Use Your Own with the API Integration Type
If you choose the **API** [integration type](#integration-type), you must use your own phone verification.
:::

:::warning Using Your Own Requires Approval
If you use your own solution for phone verification, we must approve you for [Production](../api-reference/environments#production) access by evaluating that you're properly verifying users' phone numbers.
::: */}


### Challenges

:::note Definition
A **challenge** is a piece of information we will prompt the user to input if we're unable to source data for them based on previous inputs (for example, phone). 
:::

Choose which challenge(s) to allow:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Birthday or SSN4 <Chip label="Recommended" variant="outlined" size="small" color="primary"/></td>
        <td>Prompt the user for their birthday, SSN4, or both (only if necessary). Birthday always comes first.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Birthday only</td>
        <td>Prompt the user for their birthday only — never their SSN4.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SSN4 only</td>
        <td>Prompt the user for their SSN4 only — never their birthday.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<details>
    <summary>Why We Recommend <b>Birthday or SSN4</b></summary>

    **Birthday or SSN4** is the option we recommend because the user is only prompted for both challenges if necessary. This is quite rare, so it adds very little friction, but it increases conversion by a few percentage points.

    One example is the case of twins:
    - Based on just a phone number, we find two users.
    - We prompt for birthday, but we still find two users — because they're twins with the same birthday!
    - So, we prompt for SSN4, which narrows down to a single user.

    The birth rate of twins (and triplets, etc.) in the US is [3.2%](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/multiple.htm), so choosing **Birthday or SSN4** instead of **Birthday only** increases success rate by about that much.
</details>


### Prompt for Challenges

Choose when to prompt for challenge(s):

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Only if necessary</td>
        <td>Prompt the user for challenge(s) only if Verified can't source data based on just phone.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Always</td>
        <td>Prompt the user for a challenge upfront, every time.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

:::note
If you choose **Always**, the user will only be prompted for one challenge. 
- If you chose **Birthday or SSN4** or **Birthday only** for the [Challenges](#challenges) setting, the challenge will be their birthday.
- If you chose **SSN4 only** for the [Challenges](#challenges) setting, the challenge will be their SSN4.
:::

:::tip
Always prompting for a challenge can help improve data quality for some user populations.
:::


### Risk Signals 

:::note Definition
[**Risk signals**](../data/outputs/metadata#risk-signals) are metadata that enhance 1-Click Signup's anti-fraud capabilities.
:::

Choose which risk signals to include in Verified's responses:

<RiskSignalsOptionsTable/>

:::tip Advanced Has Extra Cost 
**Advanced** risk signals come with extra cost. They're particularly relevant if you're using 1-Click Signup for a high sensitivity use case where fraud is a major risk. 
:::

:::danger
**Off** is not recommended. It will prevent Verified from sourcing risk signals for a user and blocking them if the risk score is too high.
:::


### Default Credential Requests 

:::note Definitions
- A [**credential**](../data/outputs/credentials) is a piece of identity data about a user (like a first name or address).
- A **credential request** is how you ask Verified for a particular credential. It encodes what type of data you're asking for, whether it's required or optional, whether multiple values should be returned, etc. See the [`CredentialRequest`](../api-reference/types#credentialrequest) type for full details.
:::

Choose which [credentials](../data/outputs/credentials) Verified should try to source about the user:

    <Admonition type="note">

    <Admonition type="tip" title="What Required If Available Means"> 
        If **Optional or Required** is set to **Required if available**:

        - If data is not returned for the field, the user can optionally share it. (If **Allow User Input** is set to **Yes**, the user can edit the data. If it's set to **No**, the field is not displayed to the user.)

:::tip The SDK Automatically Adjusts Text Color for Contrast
The SDK will automaticallly adjust the color of text to achieve good contrast, given the color of an element. For example:
- If you set **Background Color** to be dark, the SDK will adjust text on the background to be light.
- If you set **Primary Color** to be light, the SDK will adjust text on buttons to be dark.
