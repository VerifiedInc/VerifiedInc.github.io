## About Text to Signup

**Text to Signup is a marketing _superpower_.** It lets you create magical ads that convert verified users instantly, both online and offline. Try it yourself using the examples below:

<div class="two-column-grid-container">
    <div class="two-column-grid-row">
        <div class="two-column-grid-column">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/84fdts">![](/img/tts-campaign-ad-examples/email-with-qr-code.png)</a>
            *Example online ad using a [magic button](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-button) and [magic QR code](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-qr-code)*
        </div>
        <div class="two-column-grid-column">
            ![](/img/tts-campaign-ad-examples/bus-stop-with-qr-code.png)
            *Example offline ad using a [magic QR code](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-qr-code)*
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

You can use Text to Signup with no code and be live in a matter of minutes! Or, you can do some (low code) integration work if it's helpful for your use case. This allows you to check that users' phone numbers are verified or take users through a [1-Click Signup](/1-click-signup) flow, where we can autofill verified data for them (such as Name, Address, Date of Birth, Full SSN, and more). See the Text to Signup [Guide](/text-to-signup/guide) for details.


## SMS Compliance

SMS campaigns in the US — especially those that use short code phone numbers — are subject to onerous compliance reviews by SMS platforms and phone carriers. We handle all of this complexity, so you don't have to. 

:::tip Marketing SMS
When a user goes through a Text to Signup flow, you'll receive their phone number. If you want to send marketing SMS to that number, it's your responsibility to get their consent to do so and handle any additional compliance that's required. Text to Signup doesn't collect such consent on your behalf, since Text to Signup doesn't send marketing SMS.

## User Experience

A user sees a Text to Signup ad.

To respond to a Text to Signup powered ad, all a user needs to do is:
1. Text a keyword to a number (e.g. Text HOOLI to 50555)
2. Click a verification they receive in an auto reply text

The [magic link](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-link), [magic button](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-button), and [magic QR code](/text-to-signup/guide#magic-qr-code) we provide make this even easier: They autofill the number and an SMS draft, so the user doesn't even have to type anything. _It takes less than 10 seconds, end to end!_ 

See [User Experience](/text-to-signup/user-experience) for full details.
