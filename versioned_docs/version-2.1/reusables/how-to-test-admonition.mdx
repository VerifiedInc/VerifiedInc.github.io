<Admonition type="info" title="How to Test">
    You can test with:
    1. **Your own phone number:** We recommend doing this so you can send yourself SMS for the phone verification step.
    2. **Our [test users](/test-users):** This is helpful for triggering specific error codes.
    
    You should do all testing against our [Sandbox](/environments#sandbox) environment, which returns [mock data](/environments#mock-data).
