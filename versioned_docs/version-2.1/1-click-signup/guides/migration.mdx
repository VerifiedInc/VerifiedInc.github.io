:::note 
v2.1 is a minor, non-breaking version change from v2.0, but we encourage you to migrate.

:::important
**If you're using the Non-Hosted v2.0 integration type, no action is needed!** 

As detailed below, **Non-Hosted** in v2.0 is equivalent to **API** in v2.1.

## Updates in v2.1

The most significant updates in v2.1 are:
- **We introduced an [SDK](..guides/sdk-integration),** which is _10x faster_ to integrate. It's highly customizable and handles the [user experience](../guides/user-experience) end to end, including sending SMS to users for phone verification.
- **We revamped our suite of [test users](../test-users),** making it far easier to test all possible flows of 1-Click Signup. Crucially, the new test users all have phone numbers that pass validation checks, making them much simpler to use for both manual and automated testing.
- **We changed the available integration types:** The [integration types in v2.0](../v2.0/integration-guide#2-configure-brand-settings) are updated to [integration types in v2.1](../guides/setup#integration-type) as follows:
    - **Hosted** in v2.0 is replaced by **SDK** in v2.1
    - **Semi-Hosted** in v2.0 is no longer available in v2.1
    - **Non-Hosted** in v2.0 is equivalent to **API** in v2.0


## Migrate from Hosted v2.0

**If you're using the Hosted v2.0 integration type, you should [migrate to SDK v2.1](#migrate-to-sdk-v21).** This is very easy to do because the SDK handles more functionality (hosting the Phone screen and sending SMS), so you can remove much of what you needed for Hosted. 

Here are the differences between the integration types:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Version</th>
        <th>v2.0</th>
        <th>v2.1</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Integration Type</th>
        <th>Hosted</th>
        <th>SDK</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>User Interface</td>
        <td>Partly Hosted by Verified <br/> (no Phone screen)</td>
        <td>Fully Hosted by Verified <br/> (embeddable as SDK)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Phone Verification Code</td>
        <td>Generated by Verified</td>
        <td>Generated by Verified</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SMS</td>
        <td>Sent by You</td>
        <td>Sent by Verified (or You)</td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Migrate to SDK v2.1

**All you need to do is integrate the SDK, which is extremely easy!** Just follow the v2.1 [Setup](../guides/setup) and [SDK Integration](../guides/sdk-integration) guides. It should take no more than half a day.

:::tip
**You can remove the Phone screen and SMS sending you implemented for Hosted v2.0.** There's no need for them now: the SDK handles everything for you.
:::


## Migrate from Semi-Hosted v2.0

**If you're using the Semi-Hosted v2.0 integration type, you can either [migrate to SDK v2.1](#migrate-to-sdk-v21) or [migrate to API v2.1](#migrate-to-api-v21):** 
- We generally recommend using the **SDK** integration type in v2.1 because it handles all functionality (including hosting the user interface and sending SMS) and is highly customizable, so it's extremely easy to use in a way that matches your branding. It also implements the hyper-optimized [user experience](../guides/user-experience) our team has honed with countless hours of research, design, testing, and iteration.
- However, with the Semi-Hosted integration type in v2.0, you're already hosting your own user interface and sending SMS, so you have most of what you need in place to use the **API** integration type in v2.1. So, this would be a good option for you if you want to keep your existing user experience in place.

:::tip
**Migrating to either integration type is easy,** so it's just a question of what you prefer!

    <tr>
        <th>Version</th>
        <th>v2.0</th>
        <th colspan="2">v2.1</th>
    </tr>

        <th>Integration Type</th>
        <th>Semi-Hosted</th>
        <th>SDK</th>
        <th>API</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>User Interface</td>
        <td>Hosted by You</td>
        <td>Hosted by Verified <br/> (embeddable as SDK)</td>
        <td>Hosted by You</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Phone Verification Code</td>
        <td>Generated by Verified</td>
        <td>Generated by Verified</td>
        <td>Generated by You</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>SMS</td>
        <td>Sent by You</td>
        <td>Sent by Verified (or You)</td>
        <td>Sent by You</td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Migrate to SDK v2.1

**All you need to do is integrate the SDK, which is extremely easy!** Just follow the v2.1 [Setup](../guides/setup) and [SDK Integration](../guides/sdk-integration) guides. It should take no more than half a day.

:::tip
**You can remove the user interface and SMS sending you implemented for Semi-Hosted v2.0.** There's no need for them now: the SDK handles everything for you.
:::


### Migrate to API v2.1

**All you need to do is the following.** It should take no more than a day.

1. **Generate and check phone verification codes:** With API integration type in v2.1, Verified does not generate or check phone verification codes for you, so you'll need to do this yourself. You can also use a dedicated third party service (like [Twilio Verify](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/user-authentication-identity/verify)) for this if you prefer.
2. **Update your API calls:**
    1. **Remove the first `POST /1-click` call** (step 2 under Semi-Hosted in the table below). _This call was to have Verified generate a phone verification code, which in API v2.1 you do yourself._
    2. **Replace the `GET /1-click` call** (step 5 under Semi-Hosted in the table below). Call `POST /1-click` instead. _You'll receive either data or an error. The same error handling you have in place for the `GET` call will work for the `POST` call._
    3. **Replace the `PATCH /1-click` call** (step 7 under Semi-Hosted in the table below). Call `POST /1-click` instead (with additional info from the user). _You'll receive either data or an error. The same error handling you have in place for the `PATCH` call will work for the `POST` call._

**That's it!**

See the v2.1 [API Integration](../guides/api-integration) guide for full details. Here are the differences in steps between the integration types:
