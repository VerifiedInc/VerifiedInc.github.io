To use 1-Click Health, your company must be a healthcare **provider** with one or more [NPIs (National Provider Identifiers)](https://www.cms.gov/regulations-and-guidance/administrative-simplification/nationalprovidentstand). Verified uses your NPIs — and the input user data you provide — to source user health insurance data from **payers.** We’re able to source this data from most payers immediately, but some payers require additional enrollment steps to be completed before they start returning data.

We handle as much of the payer enrollment process as possible, to save your team time and effort. We can complete enrollments with many payers on your behalf, without additional work from you. There are some payers, however, that require steps only you can complete. This guide contains comprehensive instructions for how you can complete the steps such payers require.

The Verified team is available at any time to assist. Don’t hesitate to reach out to us at Support@Verified.inc or on Slack, and we’ll help in any way we can.

:::info Completing These Enrollments is Optional
**You can ignore instructions for any payer that's irrelevant to your use case or that has steps you deem too burdensome.** The downside is simply that we won’t be able to autofill health insurance data for users of such a payer.
