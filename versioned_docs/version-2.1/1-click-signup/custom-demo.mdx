Our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc) lets you experience 1-Click Signup firsthand, both in [Sandbox](./api-reference/environments#sandbox) (with mock data) and [Production](./api-reference/environments#production) (with your real, verified data).


## Generate a Custom Demo

You can instantly generate a custom version of the Demo anytime on our [website](https://www.verified.inc/) or using the form below. Just enter your work email, and we'll brand the Demo with your company's name, logo, and color:

<DemoEmailForm />

<WorkEmailAdmonition />

## Access the Demo from the Dashboard

You can also open versions of the Demo specific to your brand settings from within the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc):
1. Log into your Dashboard account.
2. Go to the Brand Details page for one of your brands.
3. Click the **Open Demo with These Settings** button. 

This will open a version of the Demo that reflects the brand settings you have configured in the Dashboard, making it easy to test that the flow works as you want it to.
