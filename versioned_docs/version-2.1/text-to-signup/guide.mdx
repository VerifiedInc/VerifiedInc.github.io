        <Admonition type="important" title="Note: Short Phone Numbers Are Enabled Only in Production">
            If you choose the **Short** option, a short phone number will be enabled in [Production](/reference/api/environments#production) but _not_ [Sandbox](/reference/api/environments#sandbox). This is because short code phone numbers are not suitable for testing, as they're subject to strict carrier compliance review.
        </Admonition>

        <Admonition type="tip">
            **We recommend using the **Short** option because it's easier for users to type and therefore makes the [call to action](#call-to-action) higher converting.** However, some use cases may not need to use the call to action, which prompts users to manually type the brand phone number. Such uses cases may instead only use the [magic link](#magic-link), [magic button](#magic-button), and/or [magic QR code](#magic-qr-code), which autofill the brand phone number and [SMS draft](#sms-draft) for the user so they don't need to type anything. For these use cases, the **Long** option may be best.

#### Campaigns

**Create up to 10 campaigns for a given brand. For each campaign, configure the following settings:**

        ##### Keyword
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        > Triggers Text to Signup when a user includes it in an SMS they send to the [brand phone number](#brand-phone-number)

        **Choose a keyword for the campaign.** The keyword can be any text (including emojis) that passes the following validation:
        - Must not be longer than 153 characters if it only includes [GSM-7 characters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding), or 67 characters if it includes any non-GSM-7 characters (like emojis).
        - Must not be a keyword already used with the [brand phone number](#brand-phone-number).
        - Must not be a reserved keyword:
            <details>
                <summary>Reserved Keywords</summary>
                    - STOP

                    - INFO
            </details>

        **Examples:**
        - HOOLI
        - ü©µ

        <Admonition type="note" title="Keywords are Case Insensitive">
            Keywords are case insensitive. For example, "HOOLI" and "Hooli" are considered the same. However, **we recommend using an all caps version of the keyword in the [SMS draft](#sms-draft) (see below) and campaign ads,** since it makes it easier for users to understand what to do.
        </Admonition>

    <CollapsibleSection>

        <CollapsibleHeader>
        ##### SMS Draft
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        > Draft SMS that's autofilled in a user's messaging app when they use a Text to Signup magic link, button, or QR code

        **Write an SMS draft for the campaign.** The SMS draft can be any text (including emojis) that passes the following validation:
        - Must include the campaign [keyword](#keyword).
        - Must not be longer than 153 characters if it only includes [GSM-7 characters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-gsm-7-character-encoding), or 67 characters if it includes any non-GSM-7 characters (like emojis).

        **Examples:**
        - HOOLI - Send this message to experience the magic! ->
            - _This example has only GSM-7 characters._
        - ü©µ Send this message to experience the magic! ‚û°Ô∏è
            - _This example includes non-GSM-7 characters._

        <Admonition type="tip" title="Tips">
            - We recommend using using an all caps version of the [keyword](#keyword) so that it's clear to the user what word they need to type (if they choose to manually type the keyword in an SMS).
            - We recommend including "Send this message" and either "‚û°Ô∏è" or "->" at the end of the message to help guide the user toward sending the SMS draft, which will trigger Text to Signup because it includes the campaign [keyword](#keyword).

        ##### Redirect URL
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        > Where Text to Signup redirects a user to

        **Set a redirect URL for the campaign.** The redirect URL can be any valid URL ‚Äî whether a website link, app store link, or otherwise.

        <Admonition type="tip">
            We recommend using a campaign specific landing page, an app store link, or a page in your onboarding flow.
        </Admonition>

        **Examples:**
        - https://hooli.com/verified/text-to-signup
        - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hooli

        We will append a URL parameter to the redirect URL, based on what you choose for the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting. See [step 3](#3-if-necessary-do-integration-work) for details about whether and how to use these parameter values.

    <CollapsibleSection>

        ##### Redirect User After
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        > When a user is redirected to the [redirect URL](#redirect-url)

        **Choose when a user should be redirected:**

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Option</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Text to Signup</td>
                <td>After the Text to Signup flow (where we verify the user‚Äôs phone number)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Hosted 1-Click Signup</td>
                <td>After a [1-Click Signup](/1-click-signup) flow we host (where we autofill info and have the user confirm it)</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        If you choose the **"Text to Signup"** option, we will redirect the user after we verify their phone number. You can then optionally:
        - [Confirm the user's phone is verified.](#confirm-users-phone-is-verified)
        - [Pass the user to an integrated 1-Click Signup flow](#pass-user-to-integrated-1-click-signup-flow) on your side.

        See [step 3](#3-if-necessary-do-integration-work) for how to do this.
        
        <Admonition type="tip">
        If you've already integrated 1-Click Signup (following the [SDK Integration](/1-click-signup/guides/sdk-integration) or [API Integration](/1-click-signup/guides/api-integration) guide), the **"Text to Signup"** option is best, because it ensures you can keep your signup flow consistent for all users.
        </Admonition>

        If you choose the **"Hosted 1-Click Signup"** option, we will take the user through a hosted 1-Click Signup flow that autofills identity info and has them confirm it. You'll need to [retrieve the user's info](#retrieve-users-identity-info) to benefit from this: see [step 3](#3-if-necessary-do-integration-work) for how.

## 3. (if necessary) Do integration work.

:::important You May Not Need to Do Integration Work!
**You may not need to do any integration work for Text to Signup.** You only need to if:
1. **You need to confirm the the user's phone is verified.** This is crucial if you want to rely on Text to Signup for phone verification, including if you want to pass the user to an integrated 1-Click Signup flow on your side.
2. **You chose the "Hosted 1-Click Signup" option for the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting.** We will take the user through a hosted 1-Click Signup flow that autofills identity info and has them confirm it. You'll need to retrieve the user's info to benefit from this.

If neither of these apply to your use case, **_skip this step ‚Äî¬†you need no code!_**
:::

The integration work you can do depends on the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting:
- If it's set to **"Text to Signup"**, you can optionally:
    - [Confirm the user's phone is verified.](#confirm-users-phone-is-verified)
    - [Pass the user to an integrated 1-Click Signup flow](#pass-user-to-integrated-1-click-signup-flow) on your side.
- If it's set to **"Hosted 1-Click Signup"**, you need to [retrieve the user's identity info](#retrieve-users-identity-info).

See the sections below for details about how to do each of these.

        ### Confirm User's Phone is Verified
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        <Admonition type="note">
        This integration step is only relevant if the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting is set to **"Text to Signup".**
        </Admonition>

        <SequenceDiagramTextToSignupConfirmUsersPhoneIsVerified/>


        #### a. Parse the `verificationUuid` URL parameter.

        When a user completes Text to Signup, we redirect them to your campaign's [redirect URL](#redirect-url), appending a URL parameter that depends on the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting. When it's set to **"Text to Signup"**, we redirect the user after we verify their phone number. Therefore, we append a `verificationUuid` parameter, which lets you check that the user's phone was verified:
        ```
        {redirectUrl}?verificationUuid={verificationUuid}

        https://hooli.com/verified/text-to-signup?verificationUuid=68b7bf30-1a2d-4fcc-a2c8-be7de29e5b19
        ```

        Parse the value of this parameter, which you'll use in the next step. 

        <Admonition type="danger">
        **A user arriving at your campaign [redirect URL](#redirect-url) with a `verificationUuid` URL parameter is NOT a technical guarantee that the user's phone is verified!** If your use case needs such a guarantee, you must confirm the phone is verified using [step b](#b-call-get-1-clickverifications) and [step c](#c-check-verification-status). 
        <details>
            <summary>Why is this the case?</summary>

            A bad actor can figure out what the redirect URL is (for example by simply going through the campaign flow themselves) and then append a `verificationUuid` parameter with a random UUID value.

            So, to confirm the user's phone is verified, you need to _use_ the value of the `verificationUuid` parameter to call `GET /1-click/verifications/{verificationUuid}` (see [step b](#b-call-get-1-clickverifications)) and then check the verification `status` in the response (see [step c](#c-check-verification-status)). This _can't_ be spoofed, because a bad actor doesn't have any way of correctly guessing a _valid_ UUID value for `verificationUuid`.
        </details>
        </Admonition>


        #### b. Call `GET /1-click/verifications`.

        Call your server with `verificationUuid`, which you parsed in the previous step. The server should use your Verified API key to call [`GET /1-click/verifications/{verificationUuid}`](/reference/api/endpoints#get-1-click-verifications):

        ```
        GET /1-click/verifications/{verificationUuid}
        ```

        <Admonition type="note">
        The endpoint you should use here is **`GET /1-click/verifications`**, which is different than `GET /1-click`.
        </Admonition>

        <ApiKeysAdmonition/>

        The response will be a [`1ClickVerificationEntity`](/reference/api/types#1clickverificationentity):

        ```typescript title="GET /1-click/verifications Response Body"
        {
            ...1ClickVerificationEntity
        }
        ```
        <OneClickVerificationEntityExample/>


        #### c. Check verification `status`.

        Check that the value of `status` is `"verified"`, which means the user's phone is verified. Otherwise, it may be spoofed.

        ### Pass User to Integrated 1-Click Signup Flow
        </CollapsibleHeader>

        <Admonition type="note">
            This integration step is only relevant if the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting is set to **"Text to Signup".**
        </Admonition>

        Because Text to Signup verifies a user's phone number, you can pass the user to an integrated 1-Click Signup flow _that skips the standard phone verification process_ (enter phone, receive SMS verification code, enter verification code). The result is a frictionless, delightful user experience!

        <Admonition type="important">
            **Make sure to [confirm the user's phone is verified](#confirm-users-phone-is-verified)** before passing the user to a 1-Click Signup flow.
        </Admonition>

        How to do this depends on your brand's [integration type](/1-click-signup/guides/setup#integration-type):
        - **SDK:** Start at [step 1](/1-click-signup/guides/sdk-integration#1-create-a-session-key) in the [SDK Integration](/1-click-signup/guides/sdk-integration) guide, but include `phone` in the request body of `POST /client/1-click` (instead of using an empty request body). This will make the SDK skip the [Phone](/1-click-signup/user-experience#phone) and [Verification Code](/1-click-signup/user-experience#verification-code) screens.
        - **API:** Skip step 1 in the [API Integration](/1-click-signup/guides/api-integration) guide and go straight to [step 2](/1-click-signup/guides/api-integration#2-call-post-1-click).

        It's that simple!

        ### Retrieve User's Identity Info

        <Admonition type="note">

        </Admonition>

        <SequenceDiagramTextToSignupRetrieveUsersIdentityInfo/>


        #### a. Parse the `identityUuid` URL parameter.

        When a user completes Text to Signup, we redirect them to your campaign's [redirect URL](#redirect-url), appending a URL parameter that depends on the [redirect user after](#redirect-user-after) setting. When it's set to **"Hosted 1-Click Signup"**, we take the user through a hosted 1-Click Signup flow that autofills identity info and has them confirm it. Therefore, we append an `identityUuid` parameter, which lets you retrieve data the user shared.
        ```
        {redirectUrl}?identityUuid={identityUuid}

        https://hooli.com/verified/text-to-signup?identityUuid=68b7bf30-1a2d-4fcc-a2c8-be7de29e5b19
        ```

        Parse the value of this parameter, which you'll use in the next step. 


        #### b. Call `GET /1-click`.

        Call your server with `verificationUuid`, which you parsed in the previous step. The server should use your Verified API key to call [`GET /1-click/{identityUuid}`](/reference/api/endpoints#get-1-click):

        ```
        GET /1-click/{identityUuid}
        ```

        <Admonition type="note">
        The endpoint you should use here is **`GET /1-click`**, which is different than `GET /1-click/verifications`.
        </Admonition>

        <ApiKeysAdmonition/>

        The response will be a [`1ClickEntity`](/reference/api/types#1clickentity) that contains data (user [credentials](/reference/data/outputs#credentials) and [metadata](/reference/data/outputs#metadata)):

        ```typescript title="GET /1-click Response Body"
        {
            ...1ClickEntity
        }
        ```

## 4. Use campaign assets.

**Click the Text to Signup tab to access these assets.** You can access assets for each [campaign](#campaigns) you configured using the Campaign dropdown. The Dashboard also shows campaign ad examples to help you brainstorm creative ways to use the assets.

**Use the campaign assets in ads.** These ads can be offline or online, in just about any format you can imagine. The sections below have guidance for how to use each specific asset.

:::warning
**You are contractually required to use the [powered by Verified graphic](#powered-by-graphic) and the exact [consent language](#consent-language) ‚Äî wherever you use the other Text to Signup assets.** This is necessary for compliance with SMS regulations.
:::


### Call to Action

> Prompts user to start Text to Signup

The call to action is always of the form:

> Text `{keyword}` to `{number}`

where `{keyword}` is the campaign [keyword](#keyword) and `{number}` is the [brand phone number](#brand-phone-number).

**Examples:**

- Text HOOLI to 50555
- Text ü©µ to 888-323-7799

:::tip
**You can put the call to action _anywhere_ a user will have cell service!** It works equally well in both offline and online adds. For example, you can put it:
- on billboards
- on bus stop posters
- in TV commercials
- in radio ads
- in paper handouts
- in marketing mailings
- in emails
- in social media posts
- on web pages
- on banners flown behind airplanes
:::

:::warning
**We do _not_ recommend putting the call to action somewhere a user may have intermittent or no cell service,** for example in a subway car. Text to Signup requires a user to send and receive an SMS and load a web page, so they need to have reliable service.

### Magic Link

> Takes user to messaging app with SMS draft and phone number autofilled 

The magic link takes a user to the messaging app (on any device) and autofills the campaign [SMS draft](#sms-draft) for them. This lets them send an SMS with the campaign [keyword](#keyword) with a single click (since the SMS draft always contains the keyword).

**Examples:**

- https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/84fdts
- https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/83bc01

:::tip
**The magic link works best for ONline ads** ‚Äî like on web pages, in social media posts, in emails ‚Äî so that users can click the link. For offline ads, we recommend using the [magic QR code](#magic-qr-code).
:::


### Magic Button

> Takes user to messaging app with SMS draft and phone number autofilled 

**To use the magic button the Dashboard provides, download the image and link it to the magic link in an ad your company runs.**

The magic button takes a user to the messaging app (on any device) and autofills the campaign [SMS draft](#sms-draft) for them. This lets them send an SMS with the campaign [keyword](#keyword) with a single click (since the SMS draft always contains the keyword).

The magic button combines the [call to action](#call-to-action) and [magic link](#magic-link) to make Text to Signup clear and easy for the user. 

**Examples:**

<div>
    <a href="https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/84fdts">
        <img height={50} src="/img/tts-campaign-assets/magic-button-Text-HOOLI-to-50555.png"/>

### Magic QR Code

> Takes user to messaging app with SMS draft and phone number autofilled 

The magic QR code takes a user to the messaging app (on any device) and autofills the campaign [SMS draft](#sms-draft) for them. This lets them send an SMS with the campaign [keyword](#keyword) with a single click (since the SMS draft always contains the keyword).

**Examples:**

<div>
    <a href="https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/84fdts">
        <img height={200} src="/img/tts-campaign-assets/magic-qr-code-Text-HOOLI-to-50555.png"/>
    </a>
    *Text HOOLI to 50555*
</div>
<div>
    <a href="https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/83bc01">
        <img height={200} src="/img/tts-campaign-assets/magic-qr-code-Text-ü©µ-to-888-323-7799.png"/>
    </a>
    *Text ü©µ to 888-323-7799*
</div>
<br/>

:::tip
**The magic QR code works best for OFFline ads** ‚Äî like on billboards, in TV commercials, in marketing mail ‚Äî so that users can scan the QR code. For online ads, we recommend using the [magic link](#magic-link) and [magic button](#magic-button).

### Powered by Graphic

:::warning
**You are contractually required to use the powered by Verified graphic wherever you use the other Text to Signup assets.** This is necessary for compliance with SMS regulations.
:::

The color of the graphic depends on the [graphic color](/text-to-signup/guide#styling-settings) styling setting. We provide many variants:

<PoweredByGraphicVariantsForTextToSignup/>

**Examples:**

<div>
    <a href="https://1-click.verified.inc/tts/84fdts">
        <img width={200} src="/img/tts-powered-by-graphics/green.png"/>

    </a>
</div>
<br/>


### Consent Language 

:::warning
**You are contractually required to use the exact consent language wherever you use the other Text to Signup assets.** This is necessary for compliance with SMS regulations.
:::

The consent language is:
> Opt in to receive a verification link from Verified on behalf of `{Brand Name}`. Msg & data rates may apply. One message per interaction. Reply HELP for help or STOP to opt out. See Terms at verified.inc/sms-terms and Privacy at verified.inc/privacy.

where `{Brand Name}` is your brand name. You can copy a customized version of this from the Dashboard.

## Go Live!

:::important
    **If you did any integration work** (as part of [step 3](#3-if-necessary-do-integration-work)): That involved using a [Sandbox](/reference/api/environments#sandbox) API key, and to go live you'll need to use a [Production](/reference/api/environments#production) one:

    <details>
        <summary>Get Production Access</summary>

        1. Go to the **Brand Details** page for your brand in the Verified [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).
        2. Click the **Sandbox** tab in the upper right, and make sure your brand settings are synced. _If they're not, click the **Sync to Production** button._
        3. Click the **Production** tab in the upper right, and click the **Request Approval** button under the API Keys section.
        5. Complete the **steps** listed in the dialog.
        6. Click the dialog submit button.
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Swap Sandbox for Production</summary>

        **Once you have Production access, just swap Sandbox for Production:**
        1. Swap your Sandbox API key for your Production API key.
        2. Swap the [Sandbox base URL](/reference/api/environments#sandbox) for the [Production base URL](/reference/api/environments#production).
    </details>

    **If you did NOT do any integration work:** You don't need any API keys, because you're using Text to Signup in a no code way!
:::

**Replace the Sandbox [campaign assets](#4-use-campaign-assets) in your ads with Production ones**. To access Production campaign assets: 
1. Go to the **Brand Details** page for your brand in the Verified [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).
2. Click the **Production** tab in the upper right.
3. Click the **Text to Signup** tab in the middle.

Launch the ads on any relevant channels. 

**Then you'll be live with Text to Signup! ‚úÖ**
