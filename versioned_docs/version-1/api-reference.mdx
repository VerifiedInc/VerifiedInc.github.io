### Authentication

Every request detailed below requires an Verified Inc. API key as an `Authorization` header value.

<TestingCredentialsSnippet/>

:::caution
**API keys are sensitive, so please only use them in a secure backend service environment.** This means that ideally your clients will communicate with your own backend service, which will then call the Verified Inc. API. Your clients should never have direct access to your Verified Inc. API key.
:::


### Environments

We have two environments. Please do all integration against the **sandbox** environment.

| Environment | Base URL | Wallet URL |
|:----------|:------| :---------- |
| Sandbox | `https://core-api.sandbox-verifiedinc.com` | `https://wallet.sandbox-verifiedinc.com` |
| Production | `https://core-api.verified.inc` | `https://wallet.verified.inc` |

:::note
The sandbox domain is <code>sandbox-verifiedinc<b>.com</b></code> but the production domain is <code>verified<b>.inc</b></code>. This is purely because `.inc` domains are quite expensive!
:::


### Development

While developing your integration you can use a dummy user account if you would like.

```json test
email: richard@piedpiper.net || richard.hendricks@verified.inc
phone: +12125550010 || +550123456789
```

By using these test identifiers you can authenticate to the wallet using a static OTP value of `111111`, allowing you to test the full flow of the integration more easily. We recommend using a proper test email or phone to recieve actual verification messages during the final stages of development.

:::caution
Credentials issued to the test user will be deleted every day at 05:00 UTC.
:::


## Core Functionality

The core functionality of our API allows your brand to participate in the Verified Network through [1-Click Signup](/). For more advanced use cases like [Issue to Earn](/v1/issue-to-earn), please refer to our [advanced](#advanced-functionality) API section.

---

### 1-Click

> Begin a 1-Click Signup flow, so a <Tip type="user">user</Tip> can easily share their verified <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/1-click`

You need to provide:

1. User's phone
2. (Optional) User's email.
3. (Optional) Verification option(s). _Controls the SMS verification messaging._
4. (Optional) Content object of request page options. _To allow for minor messaging adjustments to the Wallet request page from which the user provides consent to share data._
5. (Optional) Credential request(s). (_if you would like to deviate from the default credential requests_).
6. (Optional) Redirect URL. _If you would like to redirect the user to a different URL than the one provided in your settings._
7. (Optional) isHosted. _If you would like to do the [non-hosted](/#non-hosted-flow) integration ._
8. (Optional) User's birthDate. _Only required if you are using the [non-hosted](/#non-hosted-flow) integration._

A credential requests encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to share with your <Tip type="brand"/>. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](/v1/reusables/credential-request-code-snippet) objects.

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

The endpoint comes with a default credential requests configuration shown below which should be suffice for most customers.

<DefaultCredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

:::note
This endpoint performs a similar role to [/hasMatchingCredentials](#check-user-credentials) but with a few key differences:

- Can only be used with a user's phone number
- Triggers an SMS verification message to the user that Verified Inc. sends
- Much greater chance of success getting user data than the standard acceptance flow because data is pulled on demand
:::

:::caution
The same API key necessary to call [/1-click](/api-reference#1-click-onboarding) grants you, and only, you access to the encrypted credential data documented in [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials). Please keep this key secure.
:::

#### Request Body {#1-click-request-body}

```typescript title="1-Click Request"
{
  phone: string, // user's phone number in E.164 format
  email?: string, // user's email address; optional
  verificationOptions?: 'only_link' | 'only_code' | 'both_link_and_code' // Optional: controls the SMS verification messaging. Default is 'only_code'.
  content?: {
    title?: 'Signup' | 'Verify' | 'Apply', // Optional: title of the request page. Default is 'Signup'
    description?: string, // Optional: description displayed under the consent page header. Default is 'Make sure everything is correct:'
  }
  credentialRequests?: CredentialRequest[], // Optional: a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials are being asked for
  redirectUrl?: string, // Optional: redirect url to redirect user to after the user has completed the 1-click flow. Default is the redirect url provided in your settings.
  isHosted?: boolean, // Optional: if you would like to do the non-hosted integration. Default is true.
  birthDate?: string // Optional: user's birth date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Required if you are using the non-hosted integration.
}
```

#### Response Body {#1-click-response-body}

```typescript title="1-Click Response"
{
  "url": string // Verified Inc. Web Wallet url to redirect user to for credential request handling. It will redirect back to your client. Only present if match is true.
  "match": boolean // indicates whether we can provide the user with a 1-Click Signup flow
  "smsBody": string // the SMS body that we recommend sending to the user; You will only have to handle sending the SMS in Production.
}
```

The `url` from the response ought to then be enriched with a `redirectUrl` query param that will take the next step in your target service's user onboarding webpage. _More information on this can be found in [1-Click Signup](/)._

### Trusted 1-Click

> The "trusted" 1-click sign-up flow is very similar to the standard 1-click sign-up flow, but allows for the user to skip the phone OTP step with us. The "trusted" nomenclature comes from Verified Inc. having to perform additional integration checks prior to enabling this feature for your brand.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/1-click/trusted`

You need to provide:

1. User's phone
2. User's birth date. 
3. (Optional) User's email.
4. (Optional) Credential request(s). _If you would like to update from the default credential requests._

A credential requests encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to share with your <Tip type="brand"/>. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](/v1/reusables/credential-request-code-snippet) objects.

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

The endpoint comes with a default credential requests configuration shown below which should be suffice for most customers.

<DefaultCredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

:::note
This endpoint performs a similar role to [/1-click](#1-click) but with a few key differences:

- **You must handle user's phone verification within the same session of calling this endpoint**
- The user's <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> are returned synchronously in the response body
:::

#### Request Body {#trusted-1-click-request-body}

```typescript title="Trusted 1-Click Request"
{
  phone: string, // user's phone number in E.164 format
  birthDate: string // user's birth date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Required if you are using the non-hosted integration.
  email?: string, // Optional; user's email address;
  credentialRequests?: CredentialRequest[], // Optional: a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials are being asked for
}
```

#### Response Body {#trusted-1-click-response-body}

```typescript title="Trusted 1-Click Response"
{
  "uuid": string // the 1-click uuid that can be used to update the user's credentials if they edit them post retrieval in your sign up form
  "identifiers": {
      [identifierType: string]: string
  },
  "credentials": {
      [shortenedCredentialType: string]: string
  },
  "metadata": {
      "identifiers": {
          [identifierType: string]: {
              [metadataType: string]: string
          }
      },
      "credentials": {
          [shortenedCredentialType: string]: {
              [metadataType: string]: string
          }
      }
  }
}
```

The `1-click/trusted` response is identical to the [Get `1-Click` Credentials](#get-1-click-credentials) response, but with the addition of the `uuid` attribute. This `uuid` can be used to update the user's credentials if they edit them post-retrieval in your sign-up form. You are inventive in calling the update endpoint for the benefit of [issue to earn](/v1/issue-to-earn).

### Get 1-Click Credentials

> Get the <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> of a user who has completed a 1-Click Signup flow.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/1-click/{uuid}`

When a <Tip type="user"/> completes a 1-Click Signup flow, the <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> are sent and stored securely awaiting retrieval. Additionally, as mentioned above in [1-Click](#1-click), upon the user completing the flow, the user will be redirected back to your client with a `1ClickUuid` as a query parameter.

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> related to the <Tip type="request"/> created as a result of a successful 1-Click Signup flow.

You need to provide:

- the `1ClickUuid` that was returned in the query param after redirecting the user to the `redirectUrl` attribute from the `/1-click` response

:::info
Your brand's access to 1-Click credentials is deleted after 5 minutes of the initial credential data retrieval.
:::

:::info
If in the 1-Click Response, the `credentials` attribute is not present, then means the user opted out of sharing their credentials.
But you can still use the `1ClickUuid` to check if the user verified their phone number or email address.
:::

<details>
    <summary>Definitions</summary>
    - An **identifier** is a phone number or email address the user uses to verify for 1-Click Signup.
        - `identifierType` is the type of identifier (`phone` or `email`).
    - A **credential** is a piece of data the user shares (e.g. birth date or SSN).
        - A **credential type** is a string indicating the type of a credential (e.g. `SsnCredential` or `FirstNameCredential`). It's formatted in `PascalCase` and always includes the word `Credential` at the end.
        - `shortenedCredentialType` is the shortened credential type in `camelCase`. The shortened credential type is just the type without the word `Credential` (e.g. `birthDate` or `ssn`). For subcredentials of a composite credential, it includes the shortened credential type of its parent credential(s) (e.g. `fullName.firstName`). 
            <details>
            <summary>Accepted Values</summary>

            Currently, accepted values for `shortenedCredentialType` are:
                - `email`
                - `fullName.firstName`
                - `fullName.middleName`
                - `fullName.lastName`
                - `birthDate`
                - `address.line1`
                - `address.line2`
                - `address.city`
                - `address.state`
                - `address.zipCode`
                - `address.country`
                - `ssn`
            </details>
    - **Data** in this context means identity information about a user (e.g. their name, contact information, etc.)
    - **Metadata** in this context means any additional data that's _not_ identity information about a user (e.g. the verification method for their identity information).
        - `metadataType` is the type of metadata. 
            <details>
            <summary>Accepted Values</summary>

            Currently, possible values for `metadataType` are:
                - `id`: unique identifier for a credential
                    - UUID
                    - Applies only to credentials
                - `verificationMethod`: how an identifier or credential was verified
                    - enum: `"phone_carrier"`, `"otp"`, `"self_attested"`, or `null` 
                    - Applies to both identifiers and credentials
                - `status`: status of a credential
                    - enum: `"valid"` or `"revoked"`
                    - Applies only to credentials
                - `issuerUuid`: brand that issued a credential
                    - UUID
                    - Applies only to credentials
                - `issuanceDate`: date a credential was issued
                    - Unix timestamp
                    - Applies only to credentials
                - `expirationDate`: date a credential expires
                    - Unix timestamp
                    - Applies only to credentials
            </details>

#### Response Body {#get-1-click-response-body}
  
  ```typescript title="1-Click Response"
{
    "identifiers": {
        [identifierType: string]: string
    },
    "credentials": {

        }
    }
}
```

:::tip
One particularly valuable piece of metadata is **`verificationMethod`**, which describes how the credential (piece of user data) was verified. It can take the following values:
- `"phone_carrier"`: verified via phone carrier records
- `"otp"`: verified via an OTP (one time passcode)
- `"self_attested"`: attested by the user themselves (not verified)
- `null`
:::


:::tip[User Data Format]
We support a few different formats for user data, for example the default format for the `dateBirth` credential is a unixTimestamp, but you can also request it different formats (e.g. `MM/DD/YYYY` or `YYYY-MM-DD`), or for the `state` credential, you can request it as a 2-letter abbreviation (e.g. `CA`) or as the full state name (e.g. `California`).

<details>
    <summary>Accepted Formats</summary>

    Currently, accepted formats for user data are:
    - `dateBirth`: unixTimestamp, or any combination of `y`(year), `M`(month), `d`(day), `/`(slash), and `-`(dash)
    - `state`: 2-letter abbreviation, full state name
    - `country`: 2-letter abbreviation, full country name
    - `address`: instead getting a object with all keys, you can get a string with any combination, (e.g. `line1, city, state-country`)
    - `fullName`: instead getting a object with all keys, you can get a string with any combination, (e.g. `firstName, lastName`)

### Update 1-Click Credentials

> This endpoint is to be used for updating the 1-click credentials passed to your brand in the 1-click non-hosted and 1-click trusted flows.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/1-click/{uuid}/credentials`

You need to provide:

1. **The 1-click uuid**
2. **The credential values in same format they were provided.** See example below.

<SimplifiedCredentialsExample />

This is an optional endpoint only relevant for the 1-click [non-hosted](/#non-hosted-variant) and [trusted](/#trusted-variants) variants. Because we send the user's data directly to your application, without the user using our web Wallet (which is part of the hosted variant), the user never gets a chance to update any of the data that's autofilled for them. If you allow them to editing and/or enrich their data on your side,  within a UI/UX that you manage and implement, you can use this endpoint to pass that information back to us (and earn revenue share as a result).

:::important
If this endpoint is optional, why use it?

If you to call this endpoint after the user has made edits to their data on your side, you will earn a share of the revenue generated when the user uses that data elsewhere.revenue streams.
:::

#### Request Body {#update-1-click-credentials-request-body}

```typescript title="Update 1-Click Credentials Request Body"
{
  "uuid": string // the 1-click uuid from the POST /1-click/trusted response
  "credentials": {
      [shortenedCredentialType: string]: string
  }
}
```

The response body will contain credentials conforming to [credential schemas](/v1/schema#example). Please see the [Postman](https://api.docs.verified.inc/#159ad031-30da-4e2b-afbb-c2abf15bd194) docs for examples of this response body.

#### Response Body {#update-1-click-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="1-Click Response"
[
  {
    type: string, // credential type
    verificationMethod: string // verification method
    data: CredentialsList | {
      [credentialKey: string]: string // credential data
    },
  }
]
```

The response body is currently in a more verbose format than that of the response for GET `/sharedCredentials` or POST `/1-click` (both trusted and non-hosted). However, in practice, the details of the response body are non-consequential for you as long as a 201 HTTP status code is received.

---

## Advanced Functionality

The [1-Click Signup](/) functionality that is covered in the [core](#core-functionality) API section are higher level abstractions for these advanced endpoints. Thus, it is unlikely you will need to use these for most flows. However, for completeness please refer to this section for the advanced use cases documentation which covers endpoints mostly related to pure [Issue to Earn](/v1/issue-to-earn) integrations.

---

### Check User Credentials

> Check if a user has matching <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip>. If so, a <Tip type="request"/> is created to get the <Tip type="user">user</Tip>'s consent to share the data.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/hasMatchingCredentials`

You need to provide:

1. User's email or phone
2. (Optional) Credential request(s). _Required if Partner UUID is not provided._
3. (Optional) Partner UUID.
4. (Optional) List of the sub-credentials that make up the credential. _If not provided, all sub-credentials will be returned._

A credential requests encodes which <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> you're asking the user to share with your <Tip type="brand"/>. It's a list of one or more [`CredentialRequest`](/v1/reusables/credential-request-code-snippet) objects.

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

If you list multiple <Tip type="issuer">issuers</Tip>, the user can include a credential issued by _any one_ of those listed. If `issuers` is left empty the user can include a credential with matching type issued by _any_ issuer.

:::note
The Credential <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> attribute is required if a Partner UUID is **not** provided. If Partner UUID is provided, the Credential requests attribute is not used. Instead, a pre-defined set of accepting partner's credentials requests are used.
:::

:::tip
If <b>mandatory</b> field are missing, then the credential will be treated as optional.
:::

:::note
The Credential <Tip type="request">requests</Tip> objects can contain a `children` attribute. This attribute is used to specify the sub-credentials that make up the credential. If not provided, all sub-credentials will be returned.
(eg: If you request a <Tip type="credential">credential</Tip> of type `AddressCredential` and you only want the `city` and `state` sub-credentials, you can specify that in the `children` attribute.)
:::

:::caution
The same ApiKey necessary to call /hasMatchingCredentials grants you and only you access to the encrypted credential data documented in [Get Shared Credentials](#get-shared-credentials). Please keep this key secure.
:::

#### Request Body {#check-user-credentials-request-body}

```typescript
{
  email?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  phone?: string, // user's phone number; optional if email is provided
  credentialRequests: CredentialRequest[], // a list of one or more CredentialRequest objects. Encodes which credentials are being asked for; not used if partnerUuid is provided
  partnerUuid?: string, // partner's uuid; optional
  description?: string // A description displayed in the consent page header. If no description is provided, a default value will be displayed.
}
```

#### Response Body {#check-user-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="HasMatchingCredentials"
{
  "match": boolean, // indicates whether the user has matching credentials
  "url": string // Verified Inc. Web Wallet url to redirect user to for credential request handling. It will redirect back to your client. Only present if match is true.
}
```

The `url` from the response ought to then be enriched with a `redirectUrl` query param that will take the next step in your target service's user onboarding webpage.

:::info Example Credential Request

For example, if you want to check if a user has credentials of type `SsnCredential`, `FullNameCredential` and `AddressCredential` issued by any issuer you would send the following request:

<details>
<summary>Request Body</summary>
<p>

```json
{
  "email": "richard@piedpiper.net",
  "credentialRequests": [
    {
      "type": "SsnCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "mandatory": "yes"
    },
    {
      "type": "FullNameCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "mandatory": "yes"
    },
    {
      "type": "PhoneCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "mandatory": "if_available",
      "allowUserInput": true
    },
    {
      "type": "AddressCredential",
      "issuers": [],
      "children": [
        {
          "type": "CityCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "if_available"
        },
        {
          "type": "StateCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "yes"
        },
        {
          "type": "CountryCredential",
          "issuers": [],
          "mandatory": "yes"
        },
        {
          "type": "ZipCodeCredential",
          "issuers": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</p>
</details>

Let's break this down to understand what is happening here:

- `SsnCredential` is a "[single attribute atomic credential](/v1/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore does not have any sub-credentials. Because it is marked as `mandatory`, it only matches if the user has a credential.

```json title="SnnCredential"
{
  "type": "SsnCredential",
  "issuers": [],
  "mandatory": "yes"
}
```

- `FullNameCredential` is a "[composite credential](/v1/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore has *2 sub-credentials*¹: `FirstNameCredential`, `LastNameCredential`. Because it is marked as `mandatory`, and it has no `children` attribute, it only matches if the user has a credential with all sub-credentials.

```json title="FullNameCredential"
{
  "type": "FullNameCredential",
  "issuers": [],
  "mandatory": "yes"
}
```

- `PhoneCredential` is a "[single attribute atomic credential](/v1/schema#schema-definitions)" and therefore does not have any sub-credentials. Because we set a `allowUserInput` attribute of `true`, the user will be given an opportunity to enter a new value if they choose to. Note that this have not relation with `mandatory` field, it just accepts and validates the user input data."

```json title="PhoneCredential"
{
  "type": "PhoneCredential",
  "issuers": [],
  "mandatory": "if_available",
  "allowUserInput": true
}
```

- The `AddressCredential` credential is made up of 6 sub-credentials: `Line1Credential`, `Line2Credential`, `CityCredential`, `StateCredential`, `CountryCredential` and `ZipCodeCredential`.

  But because we specified a `children` attribute, we are only asking for the `CityCredential`, `StateCredential`, `CountryCredential` and `ZipCodeCredential` sub-credentials. So `Line1Credential` and `Line2Credential` are ignored.

  ```json title="AddressCredential"
  {
    "type": "AddressCredential",
    "issuers": [],
    "children": [
      {
        "type": "CityCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "if_available"
      },
      {
        "type": "StateCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "yes"
      },
      {
        "type": "CountryCredential",
        "issuers": [],
        "mandatory": "yes"
      },
      {
        "type": "ZipCodeCredential",
        "issuers": []
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

The user will be asked to share the `CityCredential` if available (this means if the user has a credential of type `CityCredential` it will be mandatory, but if the user does not have a credential of type `CityCredential` the user will still be able to share the `AddressCredential` credential).

`StateCredential` and `CountryCredential` are mandatory and therefore the user must have a credential of each type to match.

`ZipCodeCredential` is optional and therefore the user may or may not have a credential of type to match.

### Get Shared Credentials {#get-shared-credentials-request-body}

> Get verified <Tip type="credential"/> data shared by a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/sharedCredentials/{sharedCredentialsUuid}`

When a <Tip type="user"/> responds to a <Tip type="request"/> the verified data is sent and stored securely awaiting retrieval. Additionally, as mentioned above in [Check User Credentials](#check-user-credentials), upon the user responding to the request, the user will be redirected back to your client with a `sharedCredentialsUuid` as a query parameter.

This endpoint allows you to retrieve the shared <Tip type="credential">credentials</Tip> data related to the <Tip type="request"/> created as a result of a successful match from the `/hasMatchingCredentials` endpoint.

You need to provide:

- the `sharedCredentialsUuid` that was returned in the query param after redirecting the user to the `redirectUrl` attribute from the `/hasMatchingCredentials`response

:::info
Your brand's access to shared credentials is deleted after 5 minutes of the initial credential data retrieval.
:::

The response body consists of Credential objects with the plaintext user data.

```typescript title="Credential"
{
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "issuer": string, // credential issuer brandId
    "issuanceDate": number, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate"?: number, // when credentials expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credential[] // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
}
```

#### Response Body {#get-shared-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="SharedCredentials"
{
  "uuid": string, // the uuid from the query parameter of the redirect back to your client; identifies the collection of credentials shared by the user
  "credentials": Credential[], // a list of one or more Credential objects
  "email"?: string, // the user's email from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if email was provided
  "phone"?: string // the user's phone from the input to /hasMatchingCredentials; only present if phone was provided
}
```

To facilitate extracting the credential data we recommend leveraging the Schema Resolver to get the [schema](/v1/schema) of the credential types. Because Credential schemas are immutable they can then be cached and referenced when retrieving the credential data.

### Issue Credentials

> Issue <Tip type="credential"/>s to a <Tip type="user"/>.

**Method**: `POST` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials`

You need to provide:

1. Credentials data array
2. Either a phone and/or email attribute
3. (Optional) Partner UUID.
4. (Optional) Tracking Identifier for credential usage attribute.

Data about the user, must comply with our credential [schema](/v1/schema) definitions.

An example Credentials object is below:

```typescript title="Credentials"
{
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "id"?: string, // credential id - uuid formatted; optional. If not provided, a random uuid will be generated
  "expirationDate?": number // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since unix epoch; optional
}
```

While not required, we recommend providing a unique `id` following `uuid` [format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for each credential. This allows for idempotent credential issuance - meaning if a duplicate `id` value is seen another credential will not be created. Expect a HTTP status code of `409` if this is the case. If you do not provide an `id`, a random uuid will be generated for you.

:::note
An expiration date is not the only control on whether a credential is valid. You can also change the credential's status at any time, for example to revoke it. See [Patch Credentials](#patch-credentials).
:::

:::info
Credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that the <Tip type="user"/> agrees to share with.
:::

:::info Composite Credentials
Composite credentials are credentials that are made up of other credentials. For example, a `FullNameCredential` is made up of `FirstNameCredential`, `MiddleNameCredential`(optional), and `LastNameCredential`. When issuing a composite credential, you must provide the child credentials as well.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```typescript title="Composite Credential"
{
  "type": "FullNameCredential",
  // based on the properties attribute of the schema
  // highlight-start
  // note that the data is an array of objects, not a single object
  "data": [
    {
      "type": "FirstNameCredential",
      "data": {
        "firstName": "Richard"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "LastNameCredential",
      "data": {
        "lastName": "Hendricks"
      }
    }
  ]
  // highlight-end
}
```

#### Request Body {#issue-credentials-request-body}

```typescript
{
  "credentials": Credentials[], // a list of one or more Credentials objects
  "email"?: string, // user's email address; optional if phone is provided
  "phone"?: string // user's phone number in E.164 format; optional if email is provided
  "trackingId"?: string // user tracking identifier
}
```

#### Response Body {#issue-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="CredentialsDto"
{
  "email": string, // user's email address if provided
  "phone": phone, // user's phone number if provided
  "trackingId"?: string // user tracking identifier if provided
  "credentials": [{
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": string, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since unix epoch; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate
  }],
  "url"?: string // Only present if partnerUuid was provided and conditions are met. See the Issuance Guide for more information.
}
```

The issued credential contains an `id` that you should store. You'll need this, for example, if you ever want to revoke the credential. **We recommend storing the entire credential, indexed on the credential `id`.** However, it is also an acceptable to store credential `id`s associated with a user and use the [Get Credential](/api-reference#get-credential) or [Get All User Credentials](/api-reference#get-all-user-credentials) endpoint to retrieve the full credential.

---

### Patch Credential

> Patch a previously issued <Tip type="credential"/>.

**Method**: `PATCH` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials/{id}`

You can optionally provide any of the following in the request body:

1. (Optional) new credential data
2. (Optional) new credential expiration date
3. (Optional) new credential status

Credential data must comply with our credential [schema](/v1/schema) definitions.

:::note
If a credential is expired but the status is 'valid' it is an unusable credential. Likewise, if the credential as not expired but the status is 'revoked', it is also not usable credential.
:::

:::info
Credential data is stored securely via a data privacy vault that encrypts and tokenizes the data. The data is only retrieved and decrypted for the brand that the <Tip type="user"/> agrees to share with.
:::

#### Request Body {#patch-credentials-request-body}

```typescript
{
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches the credential type's JSON schema definition
  "expirationDate?": number // when the credentials expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate
}
```

#### Response Body {#patch-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="CredentialDto"
{
  "id": string, // credential id
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
  "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
}
```

The resultant credential `id` remains the same, so after a 200 HTTP response code is received, nothing further needs to be updated on your end.

---

### Patch All User Credentials

> Patch all previously issued <Tip type="credentials"/> by your brand to a user.

**Method**: `PATCH` <br />
**Path**: `/userCredentials/{userIdentifier}`

A <Tip type="userIdentifier"/> is either a phone number or email address associated with a user.

The only credential value that can by updated in this manner is `status`. A credential status must be in the request body.

:::note
This endpoint all modifies credentials issued to the user by your brand.
:::

#### Request Body {#patch-all-user-credentials-request-body}

```typescript
{
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate
}
```

#### Response Body {#patch-all-user-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="UserCredentialsDto"
{
  "credentials": {
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
  }[]
}
```

The response body contains a list of all credentials that were modified on the `credentials` key.

---

### Get Credential

> Get a previously issued <Tip type="credential"/>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/credentials/{id}`

This endpoint returns a credential (issued by your brand) via the credential `id`.

#### Response Body {#get-credential-response-body}

```typescript title="CredentialDto"
{
  "id": string, // credential id
  "type": string, // credential type
  "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
  "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
  "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
  "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
}
```

---

### Get All User Credentials

> Get all previously issued <Tip type="credentials"/> by your brand to a user.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/userCredentials/{userIdentifier}`

A <Tip type="userIdentifier"/> is either a phone number or email address associated with a user.

:::note
This endpoint all modifies credentials issued to the user by your brand.
:::

:::caution
It should be clear that this endpoint should not be used in place of [`/hasMatchingCredentials`](/api-reference/#check-user-credentials), which can check user credentials across many issuers but does not return the credentials' values.

This endpoint is simply a nice to have for an issuer to see all credentials they have issued to a user.
:::

#### Response Body {#get-all-user-credentials-response-body}

```typescript title="UserCredentialsDto"
{
  "credentials": {
    "id": string, // credential id
    "type": string, // credential type
    "data": Map<string, any> | Credentials[], // credential data map/array that matches your provided data and the credential type's JSON Schema definition
    "issuanceDate": string, // when credential was created as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp
    "expirationDate?": number, // when the credential expires as a milliseconds since epoch unix timestamp; optional
    "status": 'valid' | 'revoked' // an enum to denote whether the credential is valid (all credentials are valid when first issued) — note that this is independent of the expirationDate.
  }[]
}
```

The response body contains a list of all credentials on the `credentials` key.

### Get Partner Credential Requests

> Get the partner's pre-defined <Tip type="request">credential requests</Tip>.

**Method**: `GET` <br />
**Path**: `/credentialRequests/{partnerUuid}`

This endpoint returns a list of credential requests that the partner has defined for their brand.

#### Response Body {#get-partner-credential-requests-response-body}

```typescript title="CredentialRequestsResponse"
{
  "credentialRequests": CredentialRequest[]
}
```

<CredentialRequestCodeSnippet />

:::note
This endpoint is helpful when developing the partner issuance flow.
