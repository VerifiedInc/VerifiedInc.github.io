## Background

1-Click Signup v2 is a major improvement over v1:
- **_Over 3x faster!_** API call response times are much faster, which will increase your signup flow's conversion.
- **Self service:** You can manage your API keys and brand settings via our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc), instead of having to ask us to make changes for you.
- **Easier to use:** We've further simplified the API, so in v2 it's even easier to use.


## Setup

### 1. Log into Dashboard.

    <SetupLoginToDashboard/>


## Migration

Migrating from v1 to v2 is simple and easy. How to do so depends on which variant of v1 you implemented:
- If you implemented the v1 hosted variant (the default) → Select the **From v1 Hosted Variant** tab below.
- If you implemented the v1 non-hosted variant (described in [this section](../#non-hosted-variant)) → Select the **From v1 Non-Hosted Variant** tab below.
- If you implemented the v1 trusted variant (described in [this section](../#trusted-variant)) → Select the **From v1 Trusted Variant** tab below.

<Tabs groupId="v1Variant" queryString="v1Variant">
<TabItem value="hosted" label="From v1 Hosted Variant" default>

    If you implemented 1-Click Signup v1 using the hosted variant (the default), you should **migrate to v2 where your brand's integration type is set to Hosted.** _For more information on integration types, see [Determine integration type](./integration-guide#determine-integration-type) in the Integration Guide._

    The steps below explain how to do this. Refer to the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide?integrationType=hosted) for additional details.


    ### 1. Configure brand settings.

    <SetBrandsIntegrationType integrationType="Hosted"/>

    Make sure the rest of the settings for your brand are accurate. The Dashboard tries to autofill values based on your email domain to save you time, but you may need to manually adjust some settings — in particular the terms, privacy, and default redirect URLs.

    ### 2. Update Verified API calls.


    #### a. Update Sandbox base URL and API key.

    <UpdateSandboxBaseUrlAndApiKey/>    


    #### b. Update `POST /1-click`.

    **Request:**
    - **Remove `verificationOptions`,** which is deprecated in v2. 
        - In v1, `verificationOptions` lets you specify whether `smsBody` in the response body should contain a verification code, verification link, or both.
        - In v2, only a verification `code` is returned. See **Use `code` instead of `smsBody`** below for how to use it.
    - **Remove `isHosted?`,** which is replaced in v2 by the integration type brand setting (which you set to Hosted in [Step 2](#1-configure-brand-settings)).

    <Admonition type="tip">
        You may not have been using these properties in v1 because they're both optional (`verificationOptions` defaults to `only_code` and `isHosted?` defaults to `true`). If you weren't using them, you don't need to change anything in the request body!
    </Admonition>

    **Response:**
    - **Stop using `match`,** which is not returned in v2. 
        - In v1, `match` is an explicit indicator of whether we can source data for a user. It's redundant because whether the response is an error is an implicit indicator.
        - In v2, there's only the implicit indicator of whether the response is an error.
    - **Use `code` instead of `smsBody`,** which is not returned in v2. 
        - In v1, `smsBody` includes a verification code and/or link inside our recommended language, so you can directly send `smsBody` in an SMS to the user. (The verification link is a link to our Verified Wallet containing the verification code.)
        - In v2, only `code` is returned, so you have more flexibility in what language you use for the SMS. This means you need to construct the SMS body yourself. We recommend using this language, where `{Brand Name}` is your brand name:

            > Enter this code to verify for `{Brand Name}`: `code`

            For example:

            > Enter this code to verify for Hooli: 123456

    - **Send the user an SMS containing `code`**, since we don't send SMS in Sandbox in v2.
        - In v1, we send SMS for you in Sandbox. This makes it easier to test initially, but it ultimately complicates the integration process because we can't send SMS for you in Production (due to US SMS regulations).
        - In v2, we've eliminated this difference: we no longer send SMS for you in Sandbox (and we still don't in Production). So, you need to send SMS yourself in Sandbox as part of your testing process.

    <HowToConstructAVerificationLink/>

    <Admonition type="important" title="The Verification Code Format Is Different">
        In v1, the verification code is formatted as 6 digits with a hyphen in the middle, like `111-111`.

        In v2, the verification code is formatted as just 6 digits, like `111111`, so you can more easily present the code in the format that's best for your use case.

        We still generally recommend including a hyphen in the middle because it helps the user read and remember the code if they need to. (2 groups of 3 digits is easier to parse than 6 digits in a block.)
    </Admonition>


    #### c. Update `GET /1-click`.

    **Request:**
    - **Use `identityUuid` instead of `1ClickUuid`,** which is renamed in v2. 
        - In v1, we add a `1ClickUuid` URL parameter to the URL we redirect the user to at the end of the 1-Click Signup flow.
        - In v2, this is renamed `identityUuid`, so you should update your URL parsing code.

    **Response:** _The response is the same for v2 as for v1, so no need to update anything there!_

<TabItem value="non-hosted" label="From v1 Non-Hosted Variant">

    If you implemented 1-Click Signup v1 using the non-hosted variant (described in [this section](../#non-hosted-variant) of the 1-Click Signup v1 guide), you should **migrate to v2 where your brand's integration type is set to Semi-Hosted.**  _For more information on integration types, see [Determine integration type](./integration-guide#determine-integration-type) in the Integration Guide._

    The steps below explain how to do this. Refer to the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide?integrationType=semi-hosted) for additional details.


    ### 1. Configure brand settings.

    <SetBrandsIntegrationType integrationType="Semi-Hosted"/>

    ---


    ### 2. Update Verified API calls.


    #### a. Update Sandbox base URL and API key.

    <UpdateSandboxBaseUrlAndApiKey/>    


    #### b. Update `POST /1-click`.

    **Request:**
    - **Remove `verificationOptions`,** which is deprecated in v2.

        - In v2, there's only the implicit indicator of whether the response is an error.
    - **Stop using `url`,** which is not returned in v2.
        - In v1, you append what the user inputs for the verification code (let's call it `userInput`) to `url` and then redirect the user to the resulting link, which verifies the user's input and then redirects them back to you.
        - In v2, there's no need for such a redirect, so `url` is not returned. Instead, you pass `userInput` to `GET /1-click` (see [Update `GET /1-click`](#c-update-get-1-click-1) below).
    - **Use `code` instead of `smsBody`,** which is not returned in v2. 
        - In v1, `smsBody` includes a verification code and/or link inside our recommended language, so you can directly send `smsBody` in an SMS to the user. (The verification link is a link to our Verified Wallet containing the verification code.)

    #### c. Update `GET /1-click`.

    **Request:**
    - **Add `userInput` as a parameter** to call [`GET /1-click/{uuid}?code={userInput}`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#get-1-click).
        - In v1, you append what the user inputs for the verification code (let's call it `userInput`) to `url` and then redirect the user to the resulting link, which verifies the user's input and then redirects them back to you.
        - In v2, you instead include `userInput` as a parameter on the `GET /1-click` API call. There's no need for a redirect.

    <UseUserInputAdmonition/>

    **Response:** _The response is the same for v2 as for v1, so no need to update anything there!_

    ### 3. Go live!

    <GoLiveMigrationGuide/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="trusted" label="From v1 Trusted Variant">

    If you implemented 1-Click Signup v1 using the trusted variant (described in [this section](../#trusted-variant) of the 1-Click Signup v1 guide), you should **migrate to v2 where your brand's integration type is set to Non-Hosted.** _For more information on integration types, see [Determine integration type](./integration-guide#determine-integration-type) in the Integration Guide._

    The steps below explain how to do this. Refer to the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide?integrationType=non-hosted) for additional details.


    ### 1. Configure brand settings.

    <SetBrandsIntegrationType integrationType="Non-Hosted"/>

    ---


    ### 2. Update Verified API calls.


    #### a. Update Sandbox base URL and API key.

    <UpdateSandboxBaseUrlAndApiKey/>    


    #### b. Switch from `POST /1-click/trusted` to `POST /1-click`.

    `POST /1-click/trusted` is deprecated in v2.
    - In v1, you use this separate endpoint.
    - In v2, you instead set your brand's integration type to Non-Hosted and use the base `POST /1-click` endpoint.

    **Request:** _The request body is the same for v2 `POST /1-click` as for v1 `POST /1-click/trusted`, so no need to update anything there!_

    **Response:**
    - **Use the `identity` key to access data.** The data is structured in exactly the same way as in v1, but in v2 it's keyed on `identity` (see [here](endpoints?integrationType=non-hosted#post-1-click-response)).
