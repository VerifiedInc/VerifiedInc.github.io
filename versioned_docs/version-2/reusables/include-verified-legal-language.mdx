Regulations require that users give informed consent, so you must our legal language where you start the 1-Click Signup flow. It can be included alongside or as part of other legal language you already use, but it must be displayed to the user and not just included in terms you link out to.

Use this language:

> By `{taking this action}`, I agree that [Verified](https://verified.inc) (`{Brand Name}`’s service provider) and its vendors may receive my personal info and autofill more info about me, including my social security number.

- **Replace `{taking this action}` with the action the user will take to start 1-Click Signup.** For example:
    - If you use a form with a phone number input that autosubmits, we recommend using "entering my phone number".
    - If you use a Continue button, we recommend using "clicking Continue".
- **Link "Verified" to https://verified.inc and make it a different color than the rest of the text, underlined, or both** (so the user knows it's a link).
- **Replace `{Brand Name}` with your brand name.**

Here's an example:
> By entering my phone number, I agree that [Verified](https://verified.inc) (Hooli’s service provider) and its vendors may receive my personal info and autofill more info about me, including my social security number.
