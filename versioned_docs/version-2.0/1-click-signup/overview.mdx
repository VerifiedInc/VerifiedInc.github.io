## How It Works

**1-Click Signup is the _fastest_ way to sign up new users.** With just a phone number, a user can share their verified data:
- **Full Name**
- **Email(s)**
- **Phone(s)**
- **Address(es)**
- **Date of Birth**
- **Social Security Number**
- _... and more!_

**See [Data](./data) for details.** We provide a wide range of [credentials](./data#credentials) (pieces of user identity data) and rich [metadata](./data#metadata) about them, including dozens of sophisticated [fraud signals](./data#fraud-signals).

:::info Privacy First
**A user's data is never shared without their consent.** We are committed to putting people in control of their own data. We are SOC 2 Type II certified and compliant with major regulatory frameworks like GDPR and CCPA. For more information, please see [How We Operate](https://www.verified.inc/how-we-operate).
:::

All a user needs to do is:
1. Enter their phone number
2. Verify their phone number
3. Confirm their data

_It takes less than 10 seconds, end to end!_

:::note
**In some cases, we ask for the user's birth date in addition to their phone number.** This is necessary if the phone number doesn't uniquely identify them, for example if it's part of a shared phone carrier plan.

## Coverage

We can source verified data for over 95% of US adults (253M people). The data is extremely high quality because it comes from phone carriers, credit bureaus, and other trusted providers. Thanks to this quality, the data can be leveraged as part of a KYC/AML process. It dramatically improves conversion by (1) reducing friction (because it's by far the fastest option) and (2) leading to higher pass rates (because it avoids manual error and fraud attempts). 

:::important
**We currently only cover people in the United States.** But we are soon adding new geographies. If there are particular geographies that would be most helpful for our use case, please let us know by emailing Support@Verified.ind, and we'll prioritize accordingly.
