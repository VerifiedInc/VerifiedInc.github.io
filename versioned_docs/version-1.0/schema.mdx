## Introduction

Verified Inc. enables securely sharing verified <a href="/terminology#credential"><Tip type="credential"/></a> data amongst network participants. While in theory this data can take any shape, a structured schema must be defined and followed for every credential type for the sake of all network participants.

We use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) syntax for data validation purposes via a pre-compiled [AJV](https://ajv.js.org/guide/why-ajv.html) engine. This ensures our credential schemas are robust enough to encapsulate any data while still being easily described, displayed, and validated.

## Schema Definitions

You can view all of the Verified Inc. defined credential schemas via https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema. If you want to know the schema for a particular credential type you can use that same url with the desired credential type in the path. For example, https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/EmailCredential, would yield the EmailCredential's schema information.

:::tip
We have this API documented via our public [Postman collection](https://api.docs.verified.inc/) documentation under **Schema Resolver**.

It is possible to view the response bodies from https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema in the browser, but we recommend Postman, which automatically formats the JSON response for human readability.
:::

:::important
We hope to soon make it possible for you as a <a href="/terminology#customer"><Tip type="customer"/></a> to define your own credential schemas. But **currently, we Verified Inc. define all credential schemas.** If you would like a new credential schema for your use case, please let us know and we will gladly define one for you.
:::

We currently support what can be referred to as "single attribute atomic credentials" and "composite credentials". 

Atomic credentials provide users a means of selective disclosure for <a href="/terminology#request"><Tip type="request"/></a>s with optional fields.

Composite credentials are credentials that contain multiple "Atomic Credentials". For example, the `FullNameCredential` contains `FirstNameCredential`, `LastNameCredential` and `MiddleNameCredential`. This provides a means of grouping atomic credentials with related data.

#### JSON Schema

The `/jsonSchema` path will return the JSON schema definition, e.g. https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/FirstNameCredential:

```json title="Example FirstNameCredential JSON Schema"
{
  "$id": "FirstNameCredential",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "firstName": {
      "description": "A person's first name",
      "examples": ["John", "Mary Kate"],
      "title": "First Name",
      "displayFormat": "String",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["firstName"]
}
```

For composite credential schemas, the object will contain a `allOf` property, which is an array of the atomic credential schemas:

```json title="Example FullNameCredential JSON Schema"
{
  "$id": "FullNameCredential",
  "type": "object",
  "allOf": [
    {
      "$ref": "FirstNameCredential"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "LastNameCredential"
    },
    {
      "$ref": "MiddleNameCredential"
    }
  ]
}
```

:::tip
The `$ref` property is a JSON Pointer, which is a string containing a URI fragment identifier. In this case, it is a reference to another schema. This is how we define composite credential schemas.
:::

:::note
It's important to note that each of these credentials inside `FullNameCredential` are single attribute atomic credentials, so you are able to request individually.
But if you need create or request a `CityCredential` and a `StateCredential` you will need to use `AddressCredential` so data doesn't get mismatched.

## Schema Library

Search for or select a schema, see its properties and attributes, and copy the schema JSON:

<Schemas />

## Example

First, we get the JSON schemas for the [`SsnCredential`](https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/SsnCredential), [`FullNameCredential`](https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/FullNameCredential), which contains [`FirstNameCredential`](https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/FirstNameCredential) and [`LastNameCredential`](https://schema-resolver.verified.inc/jsonSchema/LastNameCredential) and review their attributes' `description`s and `examples`.

Next, we construct valid credential bodies, according to the schemas:

```typescript
/*The credential data compliant with the Ssn, FullName (FirstName and LastName) Credentials schemas*/
const credentialsList: Credentials = [
  {
    type: 'SsnCredential',
    data: {
      ssn: '333224444',
    },
  },
  {
    type: 'FullNameCredential',
    data: [
      {
        type: 'FirstNameCredential',
        data: {
          firstName: 'John',
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'LastNameCredential',
        data: {
          lastName: 'Doe',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

```typescript title="Example Request Body for Issuing Credentials"
{
  "credentials": credentialsList, // a list of one or more Credentials objects
  "email": "richard.hendricks@pipedpiper.net"
}

```
