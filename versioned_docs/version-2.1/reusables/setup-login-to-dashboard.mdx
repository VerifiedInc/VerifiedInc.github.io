        c. (optional) Set up MFA.

    Set up multi-factor authentication with an authenticator app. This is optional until you request approval for [Production](/reference/api/environments#production) access, at which point it's required.

    </h3>

    If you're creating the Dashboard account for your company, we'll ask you to confirm your company name. _If someone on your team has already created your account, you won't need to do this._

    If your account doesn't have a brand yet, we'll automatically create one for you and take you to its Brand Details page.
