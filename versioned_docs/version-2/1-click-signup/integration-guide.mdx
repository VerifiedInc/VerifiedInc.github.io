## Setup

<CollapsableGroup>
<CollapsableSection>
<CollapsableHeader>
### 1. Access [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).
</CollapsableHeader>

<SetupLoginToDashboard/>

---

</CollapsableSection>

<CollapsableSection>
<CollapsableHeader>

### 2. Configure brand settings.

</CollapsableHeader>

On the Brand Details page in the Dashboard, you can configure settings for your brand. 

The most important brand setting is **integration type,** which affects how you integrate 1-Click Signup. 

<details>
  <summary>How to Choose Integration Type</summary>
  
    <Admonition type="tip">
        You can always start with one integration type and change it later.
    </Admonition>

    There are three options for integration type:

    | Integration Type | User Interface | Phone Verification Code | SMS | Description | Best If... |
    |:---------------- |:-------------- |:----------------------- |:- | :- | :- |
    | **Hosted** | Hosted by Verified | Generated by Verified | Sent by You | Use Verified's UI and Verified's verification code | You want the quickest implementation |
    | **Semi-Hosted** | Hosted by You | Generated by Verified | Sent by You | Use your own UI but Verified's verification code | You _don't_ already verify users' phone numbers |
    | **Non-Hosted** <Chip label="Recommended" variant="outlined" size="small" color="primary"/> | Hosted by You | Generated by You | Sent by You | Use your own UI and your own verification code | You _do_ already verify users' phone numbers |

    <Admonition type="tip" title="We Recommend Non-Hosted">
        **Non-Hosted** is the most common integration type and the one we recommend. It allows you to make 1 API call and receive user data directly in the response body. It's the simplest way to integrate 1-Click Signup, as long as you already verify user's phone numbers. If you don't already do this, Semi-Hosted or Hosted may be a better option. 
    </Admonition>

    <Admonition type="important" title="You Send the SMS, Not Verified">
        1-Click Signup is based on a phone number and requires verifying that phone number via a verification code sent by SMS. For the Hosted and Semi-Hosted integration types, we generate that code for you (and check user input against it). For the Non-Hosted integration type, you generate your own code (and check user input against it).

        **But for all integration types, you send the SMS with the verification code. Verified never sends SMS for you.** This is unfortunately necessary due to the strictness of US regulations around SMS. It protects your company and ours for you to send the SMS, so that the user receives the SMS from the company they're directly interacting with. (It also helps avoid confusion, in case you already send SMS for other purposes, so that all SMS for your company come from numbers you control.)
    </Admonition>

    Determining which option is best for you is simple. Just answer these questions:

    **a. Do you want to use Verified's UI or your own?**

    _Using Verified's UI is the easiest option, but using your own UI is more white label. You can always start with Verified's UI — for example to quickly try out 1-Click Signup — and then switch to your own UI later._
        - Verified's UI → Select **Hosted** in the Dashboard, and select the **Hosted** tab below
        - Your own UI → Continue to question b...

    **b. Do you want to use Verified's phone verification code or your own?**

    _If you don't already verify users' phone numbers, it's easiest to use a phone verification code generated by Verified. But if you already verify users' phone numbers and want to use your existing solution for that, you can use your own phone verification code._
    - Verified's phone verification code → Select **Semi-Hosted** in the Dashboard, and select the **Semi-Hosted** tab below
    - Your own phone verification code → Select **Non-Hosted** in the Dashboard, and select the **Non-Hosted** tab below
</details>

**Choose an integration type, and then select the corresponding tab below.** That way, the rest of these Verified Docs will display only content relevant to your integration type.

<Tabs groupId="integrationType" queryString="integrationType" lazy>
<TabItem value="hosted" label="Hosted" default>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="semi-hosted" label="Semi-Hosted">
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="non-hosted" label="Non-Hosted">
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Another important brand setting is **default credential requests**, which determines what user data Verified will try to source for you. 

:::note Definitions
- A [**credential**](/data#credentials) is a piece of identity data about a user (like a first name or address).
- A **credential request** is how you ask Verified for a particular credential. It encodes what type of data you're asking for, whether it's required or optional, whether multiple values should be returned, etc. See the [`CredentialRequest`](/types#credentialrequest) type for full details.
:::

When you create a new brand, the Dashboard starts you off with standard default credential requests to provide you with a helpful starting point. Edit these to reflect the user data you'd like Verified to source.

:::tip
The default credential requests are called default because they apply if you don't include the optional `credentialRequests` attribute in the request body of `POST /1-click` (which you call in step 2 of [Integration](#integration) below).

If you _do_ include `credentialRequests` in the request body of `POST /1-click`, they will override the default credential requests defined in the Dashboard. We don't recommend doing this unless your use case requires you to dynamically change credential requests on a per API call basis. _Note that if you include `credentialRequests`, it must be an array of [`CredentialRequest`](/types#credentialrequest) objects._

## Integration

<DevelopmentWorkAdmonition/>

<Tabs groupId="integrationType" queryString="integrationType" lazy>
<TabItem value="hosted" label="Hosted" default>
    <IntegrationTypeAdmonition option="Hosted"/>

    <SequenceDiagramHosted />

    <CollapsableGroup>
    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number.  

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=hosted) for an example of this._

    <IncludeGraphicAndLegalLanguage integrationType="hosted" />

    ---
    
    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 2. Call `POST /1-click`.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number. 

    <UseYourOwnPhoneNumberAdmonition/>

    <ApiKeysAdmonition/>
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain `url` and `code`, which you'll use in the following steps.

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 3. Send SMS to user.
    </CollapsableHeader>
    
    <SendSmsToUser/>

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 4. Redirect user.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    Redirect the user to `url` from the response body of `POST /1-click`. (If the user is in your mobile app, open a webview to `url`.)
    
    This `url` is a link to our web app, where we'll prompt the user to:
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Enter their verification code</li>
        <li>(if necessary) Enter their birth date</li>
        <li>Confirm their data and agree to share it with your brand</li>
    </ol>

    When the user has completed this, we'll redirect them back to you.

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 5. Parse `identityUuid` from URL.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    When we redirect the user back to you, we'll include on the redirect URL an `identityUuid` URL parameter, whose value is a UUID. 
    
    For example, if your redirect URL is `https://hooli.com/verified`, we will send the user to:
    ```json title="Redirect URL with identityUuid Parameter"
    https://hooli.com/verified?identityUuid=47e34f9c-a18b-4e67-a202-3f5389d06c08
    ```

    <Admonition type="info" title="What Redirect URL Will We Use?">
        We'll redirect the user to the **default redirect URL** set for your brand in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc), unless you overrode that default by including `redirectUrl` in the request body of `POST /1-click`.
    </Admonition>

    <LocalTestingAdmonition />

    Parse the value of the `identityUuid` URL parameter from the redirect URL. You'll use this UUID in the next step. (If the user is in your mobile app, you can now close the webview you opened in the previous step.)

    ---
    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 6. Call `GET /1-click`.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    Call [`GET /1-click/{identityUuid}`](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click) with the value of the `identityUuid` URL parameter. 
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=hosted#get-1-click-response) will be a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), which contains the user's data and metadata about it. You can use this data however you like to create a new account for the user!
    
    </CollapsableSection>
    </CollapsableGroup>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="semi-hosted" label="Semi-Hosted">
    <IntegrationTypeAdmonition option="Semi-Hosted"/>

    <SequenceDiagramSemiHosted />

    <CollapsableGroup>
    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Semi-Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number.  

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=semi-hosted) for an example of this._

    <IncludeGraphicAndLegalLanguage integrationType="semi-hosted" />

    ---
    
    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 2. Call `POST /1-click`.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    Call [`POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click) with the user's phone number.

    <UseYourOwnPhoneNumberAdmonition/>

    <IncludeBirthDateIfPossibleAdmonition/>

    <ApiKeysAdmonition/>
    
    The [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain `uuid` and `code`, which you'll use in the following steps.

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 3. Send SMS to user.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    <SendSmsToUser/>

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 4. Prompt user for verification code.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    We recommend using a form with a numeric input that automatically submits when the user enters 6 digits (because `code` has 6 digits).

    Let's call what the user inputs `userInput`. You'll use this in the next step.

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 5. Call `GET /1-click`.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    Call [`GET /1-click/{uuid}?code={userInput}`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#get-1-click) with `uuid` from the [response body of `POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) and `userInput`.

    <UseUserInputAdmonition/>

    One of two things should happen:
    - **Success:** If we can source data based on just the phone number, the [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response) will contain a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), keyed on `identity`, that contains the user's data and metadata about it. In this case, continue to [step 8](#8-prompt-user-to-confirm-their-data).
    - **Error:** Otherwise, the response body will contain an [error](./errors) indicating that the code was invalid or we need additional information (the user's birth date) to source data. In the case of an incorrect `code`, the error code will be [`OCE008`](./errors#oce008). Only three invalid attempts are allowed, after which an error with error code [`OCE018`](./errors#oce018) will be returned. In the case of needing additional information, continue to [step 6](#6-if-necessary-prompt-user-for-birth-date). The error will have error code [`OCE011`](./errors#oce011) and look like this:
    <ErrorExampleOce011/>

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 6. (if necessary) Prompt user for birth date.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 5" stepLink="#5-call-get-1-click"/>

    We recommend using a form with a numeric input (formatted as `MM/DD/YYYY` or similar) that automatically submits when the user enters 8 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=semi-hosted) for an example of this._

    <BirthDateFormatAdmonition/>

    ---

    </CollapsableSection>

    <CollapsableSection>
    <CollapsableHeader>
    ### 7. (if necessary) Call `PATCH /1-click`.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    <WhenStepIsNecessaryAdmonition stepName="step 5" stepLink="#5-call-get-1-click"/>

    Call [`PATCH /1-click/{uuid}`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#patch-1-click) with `uuid` from the [response body of `POST /1-click`](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#post-1-click-response).

    One of two things should happen:
    - **Success:** If we can source data based on the phone number and birth date, the [response body](./endpoints?integrationType=semi-hosted#patch-1-click-response) will be a [`1ClickEntity`](./types#1clickentity) (see this [example](./types#example-1clickentity)), which contains the user's data and metadata about it. In this case, continue to [step 8](#8-prompt-user-to-confirm-their-data).
    - **Error:** Otherwise, the response body will contain an [error](./errors) indicating that the birth date didn't match. In this case, return to [step 6](#6-if-necessary-prompt-user-for-birth-date) (prompt the user for birth date again, and then call `PATCH /1-click` again). The error will have error code [`OCE012`](./errors#oce012).

    <SequenceDiagramNonHosted />

    To start 1-Click Signup for a user (using the Non-Hosted integration type), you'll need their phone number, and you'll need to verify it using your own solution.

    <Admonition type="important">
        **The Non-Hosted integration type requires you to verify phone numbers with your own solution.** If you'd like to use ours, switch to the [Semi-Hosted](?integrationType=semi-hosted#integration) or [Hosted](?integrationType=hosted#integration) integration type.

    ### 1. Prompt user for phone number and verify it.
    </CollapsableHeader>

    You can do this however you like, as long as you verify the user's phone number with a one-time verification code at least 6 digits long.

    We recommend using a form with a phone number input that automatically submits when the user enters 10 digits. _See our [Demo](https://1-click.demo.verified.inc?integrationType=non-hosted) for an example of this._

## Go Live!

When you're ready to go live:
1. Go to the **Brand Details** page for your brand in the Verified [Dashboard](https://dashboard.verified.inc).
2. Click the **Production** tab in the upper right.
3. Click the **Request Approval** button under the API Keys section.
4. Complete the steps listed in the dialog that appears:
5. Click the **Submit Request** button.

In step 4, you'll be asked to confirm the following:
<input type="checkbox" id="legal"/>
<label for="legal">**We've included a "powered by Verified" graphic and the Verified legal language.** (See step 1 under [Integration](#integration).)</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="keys"/>
<label for="keys">**We’re using Verified API keys securely: server side, never client side.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="phones"/>
<label for="phonse">**We're properly verifying users' phone numbers.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="errors"/>
<label for="error">**We’re handling relevant 1-Click Signup [error codes](./errors#error-codes).**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="ssns"/>
<label for="ssns">**If we’re requesting SSNs, we’re masking them server side and only exposing the last 4 digits client side.**</label>
<br/>
<input type="checkbox" id="testing"/>
<label for="testing">**Our 1-Click Signup flow is working end-to-end in Sandbox.**</label>
<br/>
<br/>

We will review your integration to see that it's compliant and working properly. Once we approve it, you'll have access to a [Production](./environments#production) API key on the Brand Details page. 

Just swap your Sandbox API key for a Production API key, and you'll be live with 1-Click Signup!
