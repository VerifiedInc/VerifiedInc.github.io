You can configure which risk signals you receive using the [risk signals brand setting](/guides/setup#risk-signals):
<RiskSignalsOptionsTable/>
If Basic or Advanced risk signals are enabled, we will block users with an Overall Score greater than 600 and return a [`OCE017` error](../../api-reference/errors#oce017).
