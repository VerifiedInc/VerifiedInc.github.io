<Admonition type="tip" title="How To Construct a Verification Link">
    You can also optionally use `code` to construct a verification link. For example, if `url` is a link to your application, you could:
    - Append `code` as a URL parameter to `url`: `{url}?code={code}`.
    - Set up your application to parse `code` from the URL.

    Then, you could include language like this in the SMS:

    > Click this link to verify for `{Brand Name}`: `{url}?code={code}`

    For example, if the `url` for the Hooli brand is `https://hooli.com/verified`:

    > Click this link to verify for Hooli: https://hooli.com/verified?code=123456
